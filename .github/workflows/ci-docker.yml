# CI-Docker Workflow - DISABLED (2026-02-11)
#
# Commented out to reduce CI time. The host-based CI (ci.yml) is the
# single source of truth. Docker parity was validated and confirmed.
#
# To re-enable: uncomment the 'on:' trigger and all jobs below.
# Last confirmed working: PR #37 (all 7 jobs passed)
#
# Original purpose: Validates Docker-based testing matches host-based CI.
# If this workflow fails but ci.yml passes (or vice versa), there's a drift
# between local Docker testing and CI that needs to be fixed.
