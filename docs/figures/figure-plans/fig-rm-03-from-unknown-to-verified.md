## Narrative Position

**"Hide and Seek's Journey" - Chapter 3: The Trust Progression**

This figure shows how "Hide and Seek's" credit for Mogen moves through the four attribution levels (A0→A1→A2→A3) as more sources confirm the data. It's the journey from "we think you made this" to "we KNOW you made this."

---

## Why Should I Care?

> "This is how we make sure YOUR name stays on YOUR music."

## Explain It to a Label Exec

> "Think of it like verification badges, but for music credits. You start as unknown, then claimed, then confirmed by one source, then fully verified when multiple sources agree."

---

## Mogen/Andy Personalization

**Continuing "Hide and Seek" story:**
- The progression shows a specific credit: "Imogen Heap - Vocals, Producer" moving through levels
- A0: Data exists somewhere but unverified
- A1: Mogen claims the credit through the system
- A2: MusicBrainz confirms
- A3: Discogs + streaming metadata + Mogen all agree

**Zine aesthetic connects to:**
- DIY music scene, independent artists
- Grassroots verification by the community
- Anti-corporate, artist-empowerment energy

## Visual Concept

**Style: Risograph zine progression with four "stamps" or "badges"**

## Text Content (Max 30 chars each)

### Labels
- "A0 UNKNOWN"
- "A1 CLAIMED"
- "A2 CORROBORATED"
- "A3 VERIFIED"
- "Data exists somewhere"
- "Artist says 'this is me'"
- "One external source agrees"
- "Multiple sources agree"

### Example Box
- "EXAMPLE: Imogen Heap - Vocals, Producer on 'Hide and Seek'"
- "A0 → Found in streaming database"
- "A1 → Mogen claims via the system"
- "A2 → MusicBrainz confirms"
- "A3 → All sources agree"
- "Confidence: 0.95"

### Quote Callout
- "Your word matters. When YOU claim a credit, that's the start of verification—not the end."

### Caption
Attribution levels in the system progress from A0 (unknown data) through A1 (artist claim) to A2 (external confirmation) and finally A3 (multiple-source verification). This figure shows how a credit for Imogen Heap on "Hide and Seek" moves through each stage.

## Style-Specific Prompt

```
Create a risograph-style zine page showing four trust levels as progression badges.

STYLE: DIY indie zine aesthetic
- 2-3 spot colors with visible misregistration (offset printing effect)
- Spot colors: Fluorescent pink + teal + black on cream newsprint
- Visible paper texture (newsprint grain)
- Hand-drawn elements mixed with bold typography
- Imperfect, human, grassroots energy
- Think: indie record label promotional material

COMPOSITION:
- Top: Title "FROM UNKNOWN TO VERIFIED" in bold condensed type
- Middle: Four badges/stamps arranged left-to-right (A0→A1→A2→A3)
- Each badge shows progress bar filling up
- Arrows between badges (hand-drawn, organic)
- Below badges: Simple one-line explanations
- Bottom half: Example box showing "Hide and Seek" progression
- Very bottom: Empowering quote about artist input

BADGES:
- A0 "UNKNOWN" - progress bar empty, ghostly/faded
- A1 "CLAIMED" - progress bar 1/4 full, solid
- A2 "CORROBORATED" - progress bar 3/4 full
- A3 "VERIFIED" - progress bar full, extra emphasis

MOOD: Empowering, grassroots, DIY energy. This is about artists taking control.

TEXT: Mix of typewriter, hand-lettering, and bold sans-serif. All readable despite risograph aesthetic.
```

### Negative Prompt
```
corporate design, clean modern aesthetic, gradient fills,
photorealistic, 3D rendering, perfect alignment,
sci-fi aesthetic, glowing effects, neon, cyberpunk,
polished/professional finish, stock imagery,
tech startup visual language, flowchart software style,
pure white background, glossy finish,
single solid color (need visible spot color layers)
```

## Alt Text

Risograph-style zine page showing four attribution trust levels as progression badges. From left to right: A0 (Unknown) with empty progress bar, A1 (Claimed) with quarter-full bar, A2 (Corroborated) with three-quarters-full bar, and A3 (Verified) with full bar. Below, an example shows Imogen Heap's "Hide and Seek" credit progressing through each level. A quote states: "Your word matters—when YOU claim a credit, that's the start of verification."
