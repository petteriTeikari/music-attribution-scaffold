## Narrative Position

**Who is the system For? - The User Personas**

This figure introduces the primary user personas as a portrait gallery: Mogen (the Grammy-winning independent artist), Andy (the creative technologist/art director), and "Friends" (representing session musicians, heritage artists, and platform partners).

---

## Why Should I Care?

> "These are the people we're building for—and you might be one of them."

## Explain It to a Label Exec

> "This shows our user types: independent artists like Imogen, creative tech leads like Andy, session musicians who never get credited, legacy artists whose catalogs are a mess, and the platforms who want to do the right thing."

---

## Mogen/Andy Personalization

**MAXIMUM PERSONALIZATION - This is literally their portrait gallery:**

### Mogen Portrait
- Flowing ethereal pose (Iris van Herpen aesthetic)
- Mi.Mu gloves visible on hands, gesturing
- Surrounding elements: waveforms, musical notation, blockchain/data symbols
- Quote: "I want to know who used my music, and I want THEM to know who made it."

### Andy Portrait
- At visual workstation with multiple screens
- Album artwork floating around him
- Camera, design tools, tech elements
- Quote: "Every creative deserves proper credit for their contribution."

### "Friends" Portraits (smaller, flanking)
- **Session Musician**: Hands on bass guitar, face slightly in shadow ("The Ghost Credit Problem")
- **Heritage Artist**: Older figure surrounded by vinyl records and tape reels ("The Catalog Chaos")
- **Platform Partner**: Abstract figure representing ethical AI companies

## Visual Concept

**Style: Haute couture fashion sketch gallery - elongated figures, gestural lines**

## Style-Specific Prompt

```
Create a fashion sketch portrait gallery showing five user personas.

STYLE: Haute couture editorial illustration
- Pencil/ink sketch on Bristol board
- Elongated figure proportions (fashion illustration style)

COMPOSITION:
- Central large figure: "MOGEN" - ethereal woman with gesture-control gloves (Mi.Mu), wearing sculptural flowing garment, waveforms and musical notation emanating from hands
- Below center: "ANDY" - man at visual workstation with floating album artwork, cameras, design tools around him
- Flanking smaller figures:
  - Left: "SESSION MUSICIAN" - hands on bass guitar, face in shadow (representing invisibility)
  - Right: "HERITAGE ARTIST" - older figure surrounded by vinyl records and tape reels
  - Bottom: "PLATFORM PARTNERS" - abstract/symbolic representation

DETAILS:
- Mogen should have visible tech gloves, dynamic pose, flowing hair/garment
- Andy should look like a creative professional (not corporate)
- Supporting figures should evoke their pain points through visual treatment

PALETTE: Soft watercolors - dusty rose, sage green, warm cream, touches of gold
