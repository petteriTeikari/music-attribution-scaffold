| **Title** | Attribution Lattice — Waveforms and Graph Structure with Emergent Identity |
| **Audience** | General (landing page visitors) |
| **Complexity** | L3 (hero — highest visual impact) |
| **Location** | Landing page hero section (full-width background behind text) |
| **Priority** | P0 (Critical — first visual impression, defines the entire site feel) |
| **Dimensions** | 2400 x 900px (8:3 landscape ratio) |
| **Supersedes** | v1.0 "Spectral Tapestry" (pure waveforms), v2.0 "Auracles Identity" (faces too explicit) |

## Purpose & Key Message

A full-width hero image whose **primary visual structure is audio waveforms and an attribution graph network** organized into A0–A3 assurance tier bands. The composition is beautiful and legible as abstract data art.

But hidden within it — visible only on closer inspection — **a face emerges from negative space**: the gap between waveform bands, the contour formed by graph edge density, the void where data is absent. Like a Rubin's vase or a Dalmatian dog illusion — you see the data first, then suddenly the face clicks into view.

**First glance:** "Beautiful waveform + graph visualization with confidence tiers."
**Second glance:** "Wait — is that a face in the negative space?"
**Third glance:** "The face IS the data. The identity emerges from the attribution structure itself."

**Communicates:** "Artist identity is not separate from the data — it emerges from it."

## Why Previous Versions Failed

| Version | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| v1.0 Spectral Tapestry | Conceptually empty — pure abstract waveforms, no identity concept |
| v2.0 Auracles Identity | Faces too prominent — looked like a face illustration with data decoration. The face overwhelmed the data structure. |

**The fix for v3.0:** Invert the hierarchy. The waveforms + graph + A0-A3 tiers are the ENTIRE composition. The face is a ghost — an emergent property of how the data elements are arranged. Think negative space, not positive space. The face is the thing you DON'T draw.

## Critical Layout Constraint: Left-to-Right Build

**This image sits BEHIND hero text on the left side.**

- **Left 25%**: Near-empty cream. Sparse scattered dots, 1-2 faint waveform traces. The A0 tier zone — almost no data, maximum uncertainty.
- **Middle 35%**: Waveform bands and graph nodes build in density. A1-A2 tier transition. Graph edges begin connecting nodes into clusters. Waveform lines gain thickness and variation. This is where the negative-space face contour begins to form — but only as a side effect of data arrangement.
- **Right 40%**: Dense A3 tier. Rich graph network, bold waveform bands, high-confidence region. The face is most visible here — formed by the shape of where waveforms part around a void, or where graph edges curve to leave a face-shaped gap.

## Visual Concept: Data-First, Identity-Emergent

### PRIMARY STRUCTURE — Audio Waveforms (60% of visual weight)

The backbone of the composition. Horizontal waveform bands span the full width:

- **8-12 waveform lines** at varied thickness (hairline 1px to bold 4-5px)
- **Irregular spacing** — clustered in some vertical zones, sparse in others
- **Varied waveform shapes** — some smooth sine-like, others jagged/noisy (representing different audio features: pitch contour, spectral envelope, amplitude)
- **Colors**: Navy (#1E3A5F) for bold lines, warm gray (#8B7E6A) for thin lines, selective coral (#E84C4F) fills on 1-2 key bands
- **THE FACE TRICK**: In the right half, waveform lines subtly curve/part to create a face-shaped negative space between them. The lines don't draw a face — they AVOID a face-shaped area, like water flowing around a stone. The cream background showing through the gap is the face.

### PRIMARY STRUCTURE — Attribution Graph Network (30% of visual weight)

Overlaid on and woven through the waveform bands:

- **Nodes**: Filled circles (4-10px) in coral, teal, and navy. Denser on the right.
- **Edges**: Thin connecting lines (1px) in warm gray. Form triangulated mesh in dense areas, sparse connections on the left.
- **A0-A3 tier density gradient**: Left side has isolated nodes (A0 — unverified). Moving right, nodes cluster and connect more densely (A1 → A2 → A3).
- **THE FACE TRICK**: Graph edge routing subtly avoids the face-shaped void. Or: nodes cluster to form features (two dense clusters where eyes would be, a curve of nodes for a jaw). But this is SUBTLE — the graph reads as a data network first, face second.

### A0-A3 ASSURANCE TIER BANDS (organizing principle)

The composition is implicitly organized into 4 vertical zones that mirror assurance levels:

```
A0 (left)    │    A1          │    A2          │    A3 (right)
─────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────
Sparse dots  │  Thin waveforms │  Dense waveforms│  Rich lattice
Few nodes    │  Some edges     │  Graph clusters │  Full mesh
No confidence│  Low confidence │  Medium conf.   │  High conf.
Gray tones   │  + some navy    │  + teal appears │  + coral accent
Maximum      │  Uncertainty    │  Resolution     │  Verified
uncertainty  │  reducing       │  emerging       │  identity
```

- **A0 zone**: Almost empty. A few warm gray dots. One faint waveform trace.
- **A1 zone**: Waveform lines appear but thin and uncertain. A few graph nodes, barely connected.
- **A2 zone**: Waveforms gain confidence (thicker, more defined). Graph edges multiply. Teal color enters. The face void begins to form.
- **A3 zone**: Dense, rich, confident. Bold waveform bands + interconnected graph mesh. Coral accents mark verified data points. The face is clearest here — but still only in negative space.

Small tier markers — tiny labels "A0", "A1", "A2", "A3" in IBM Plex Mono at ~8px, very faint warm gray — can sit at the bottom edge of each zone. These are the ONLY text allowed.

### THE GHOST FACE (emergent, not drawn)

**How the face appears without being drawn:**

1. **Negative space between waveform bands**: In the right half, waveform lines curve slightly to leave a face-profile-shaped gap. The cream background visible through the gap reads as a face silhouette — like seeing a face in clouds.

2. **Graph edge density contour**: The boundary between dense graph mesh and sparse area happens to trace a face profile. The face is the EDGE of the data, not the data itself.

3. **Node clustering**: Two slightly denser node clusters where eyes would be. A subtle curve of nodes suggesting a jaw. But if you didn't know to look for a face, you'd just see "data clustering."

**How subtle?** Think of the FedEx arrow — once you see it, you can't unsee it, but many people look at the logo for years without noticing. The face should be at that level of subtlety, or slightly more visible (since we want the "aha" within a few seconds of looking, not years).

**Only ONE face profile** — not multiple faces. A single face emerging from the data on the right side. Profile view (facing left, toward the text) works best for negative space since it's simpler to read.

The `☽` shape in the right zone represents the negative-space face — the ABSENCE of data where a face profile would be, surrounded by dense waveform + graph structure.

### What This Should Feel Like

- **From a distance (thumbnail)**: Beautiful abstract data visualization building from sparse to dense, left to right. Warm colors, editorial feel. "Data art."
- **At medium view (landing page)**: You notice the A0→A3 progression — uncertainty resolving into confidence. The waveforms and graph mesh are clearly about sound/data. Something about the right side feels like it has a shape...
- **Up close / "aha" moment**: The face clicks. A profile emerges from the negative space between waveform bands and the contour of graph edge density. "Oh — the identity IS the data."

## Nano Banana Pro Prompts

### Style prompt

Flat 2D editorial data visualization on warm cream background (#f6f3e6). Dense overlapping audio waveform bands and graph network mesh in constructivist poster style. Bold geometric composition — Warp Records aesthetic meets scientific data art. Horizontal waveform lines at varied thickness weave across the canvas. Graph network nodes (small filled circles) connected by thin edges form a triangulated mesh that increases in density from left to right. Navy (#1E3A5F), teal (#2E7D7B), coral red (#E84C4F), warm gray (#8B7E6A). Risograph print feel with halftone grain texture. Matte flat finish. NO 3D. NO gradients. NO shadows. Strong bold outlines on key waveform shapes. Overlapping geometric elements. Ultra-wide landscape 8:3 ratio.

### Content prompt

Ultra-wide landscape composition (2400x900px). Data density builds dramatically from left to right across FOUR IMPLICIT ZONES representing assurance levels A0 through A3:

LEFT QUARTER (A0 — sparse): Near-empty warm cream (#f6f3e6). Only a few scattered warm gray dots (4-6px), one or two very faint thin waveform traces (1px, warm gray #8B7E6A at 20% opacity). Maximum negative space.

LEFT-CENTER (A1 — emerging): Thin waveform lines (1-2px) begin to appear in navy (#1E3A5F) and warm gray. A few small graph nodes (teal #2E7D7B, 4-6px) with sparse connecting edges. Elements are uncertain, disconnected.

RIGHT-CENTER (A2 — resolving): Waveforms gain thickness (2-4px) and definition. Graph nodes multiply and edges form small triangulated clusters. Teal fills appear between some waveform band pairs at low opacity. A few coral (#E84C4F) accent squares (16px) mark key verified points. Layering begins — waveforms and graph mesh overlap.

RIGHT THIRD (A3 — verified): DENSE rich lattice. Bold waveform bands (4-5px navy) with confident waveform shapes. Dense interconnected graph mesh — many nodes connected by edges forming a triangulated network. Coral accent squares (28px). Coral nodes mark verified data. 3-4 layers of overlapping elements. This zone has the most visual weight and complexity.

CRITICAL HIDDEN ELEMENT: In the A2-A3 zone on the right side, the waveform bands and graph edge density subtly form a NEGATIVE-SPACE face profile facing left. The face is NOT drawn — it is the GAP, the VOID between data elements. Waveform lines curve gently to leave a face-profile-shaped area of empty cream background. Graph edges route around this void. The face should be subtle enough that viewers see "dense data visualization" first and only notice the face profile on second or third look — like the FedEx arrow or a face seen in clouds. Only ONE face, in profile, roughly 250-350px tall. The cream background showing through the gap IS the face.

Small "A0" "A1" "A2" "A3" labels in monospace at the very bottom edge, 8px, warm gray at 30% opacity — barely visible.

--no explicit drawn faces, face outlines, face illustrations, eyes, nose, mouth drawn as features, portraits, 3D render, sculptural, ceramic, shadows, glossy, metallic, gradients, smooth shading, neon glow, dark background, pure black, symmetric layout, centered composition, uniform spacing, large text, labels in the composition, annotations, font names, bar chart, pie chart, UI elements, screenshots, musical instruments, music notes, treble clef, stock photography, cartoon faces, anime faces, emoji faces, photorealistic faces, human hair, skin texture

## Anti-Hallucination Rules

These are INTERNAL instructions for the image generator. They must NEVER appear as visible text in the output:

1. **The face must be NEGATIVE SPACE** — formed by the ABSENCE of data elements, not by drawing face features. The cream background showing through gaps between waveforms/graph edges is the face. Do NOT draw eyes, nose, or mouth.
2. **Waveforms and graph are the PRIMARY visual** — they must read as a beautiful data visualization FIRST. The face is a hidden easter egg, not the main subject.
3. **Left 25% MUST be near-empty** — text overlays this area. Non-negotiable.
4. **NO 3D rendering** — flat 2D illustration only.
5. **A0-A3 density gradient is structural** — left = sparse (A0), right = dense (A3). This is the organizing principle of the entire composition.
6. **Only ONE face** — a single profile, facing left, in the right portion. Not multiple faces.
7. **The face should be SUBTLE** — if a viewer immediately says "I see a face" before seeing the data, the face is too prominent. The data visualization must dominate.
8. **Background MUST be #f6f3e6** (warm cream).
9. **Only permitted text**: tiny "A0" "A1" "A2" "A3" labels at the very bottom edge in faint warm gray mono. All other text is BANNED.
10. **Font names, color hex codes, semantic tags, pixel sizes are ALL internal** — never render as visible text.

## Alt Text

Wide landscape editorial data visualization showing audio waveform bands and graph network mesh building from sparse to dense across four assurance-level zones (A0 through A3) on warm cream background. The left side is nearly empty, representing unverified data, while the right side presents a rich overlapping lattice of bold navy waveform lines and interconnected teal and coral graph nodes. A subtle face profile emerges in negative space on the right — formed by the gap between converging waveform bands and the contour of graph edge density, communicating that artist identity is an emergent property of the attribution data structure itself.
