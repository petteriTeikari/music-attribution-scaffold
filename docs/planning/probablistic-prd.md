# Probabilistic PRD — Initial Prompt

> Saved verbatim from user prompt on 2026-02-10.

Let's create a plan now to how to expand our hierarchical PRD into deeper detailed levels, and convert the hierarchical PRD into a "probabilistic PRD" with conditional probabilities. I.e. if we choose some options from 2nd level, then the 3rd level is most likely certain kind of architectural choice, and the 4th, and so on. As you can see the PRD is now not defined in the traditional sense if this was a traditional software development project! This is now a companion repo to our academic paper in /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/manuscripts/music_traceability_v2026/submission/preprint-ssrn/music-generative-transition-ssrn.tex which then again is based on this other SSRN preprint on another domain: /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/manuscripts/mcp-review/submissions/preprint/v2-Jan13-2026/ai-passport-v2-8-3-SSRN.tex which a slight modification of /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/manuscripts/mcp-review/submissions/preprint/v1-Dec24-2025/ai-passport-v1-12-bbl-SSRN.tex which was more agentic commerce heavy. There is a larger .tex report as initial research document here: /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/manuscripts/mcp-review/archived/mcp-draft-ssrn-long.tex with more seed ideas. Document this high-level manuscript structure in CLAUDE.md so that you always find this and are aware of the "theoretical background" for this repository! So we are not proposing a single architecture with chosen libraries, but rather a general idea (the "scaffolding") that could be implemented in various approaches which the probabilistic PRD should capture then. The individual teams in the startup space (e.g. Auracles) might have very different constraints from each other for example. Some team might have more software engineers, whereas some teams might be more composed of musicians and they might prefer more low-code approaches and less of custom-code created for their MVP. The probabilistic MVP should also capture how AI is so fast-changing, and if we wait for 3 months, there might be very new set of librarires that might make sense to the developers? As well the commercial landscape might change so that the top-level PRD with high-level business requirements might change overnight forcing a very different MVP or minimum viable architecture to be taken! We should be very flexible in changing the scheme in that sense. For example we might have our data and cloud in Hetzner for example in all possible permutations of our probalistic PRD? Or in certain cases we might want to host some light frontend on Vercel with a separate backend somewhere else, or full stack in Render before doing "real production deployment with Terraform/Pulumi" in big three Clouds! Save this prompt verbatim to /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/docs/planning/probablistic-prd.md and let's continue working on it and feel free to ask more questions to get the initial specs right before continuing with this unorthodox PRD creation
