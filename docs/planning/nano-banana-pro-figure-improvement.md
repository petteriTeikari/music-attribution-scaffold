# Nano Banana Pro Figure Improvement — User Prompt (verbatim)

I created the figures and need to update some of those as they do not seem very informational wuth information gain over the "body text" and some of them seem too much like elegant figures for the sake of being elegant without communicating much. See figures in /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/docs/figures/frontend-figures : 1) fig-topic-01-calibrated-confidence does indeed show a textbook calibration curve and the concept of under- and overcalibration but our target audience is now both music ML people and domain experts and it would be nice in general to come up with more laypeople explanations to the landing page, so that the "complicated tech papers" would be interpreted and contextualized to these people who often confuse confidence with uncertainty quantification, do not know about different types of LLM uncertainties and what calibration (reliability, see the screenshot) in this context mean! Read http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20199 again and get the basic concepts there and conceptualize for our music question! This fig-topic-02-uncertainty-vs-confidence should have thus better idea of the 4 typesdata uncertainty (epistemic), model uncertainty (aleatoric), operational uncertainty and output uncertainty (see screenshot). And these two figures seem quite information-packed by nature so feel free to pack more information to a single infographic like we did in the paper /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/manuscripts/music_traceability_v2026/figures/fig04-assurance-levels.md

/home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/sci-llm-writer/manuscripts/music_traceability_v2026/figures/fig08-data-protection-framework.md. fig-topic-03-uncertainty-propagation looks visually stunning but I don't really know what it communicates in the end? If we re-read https://arxiv.org/html/2506.17419v1 (see screenshot) . 4) in fig-topic-04-conformal-prediction you have the word prediction twice. And you have not communicated clearly enough how selective prediction is not always done with conformal prediction, and selective prediction from SConU (http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14154) is a special variant that could be used to operationalize the risk-aversity of the the human attributer or we could learn how to adaptively set that as part of our smart UX vision (e.g. that active learning figure). For fig-topic-05-etl-pipelines we could use the word harmonize rather than normalize? See e.g. Santos, Aécio, Eduardo H. M. Pena, Roque Lopez, and Juliana Freire. 2025. "Interactive Data Harmonization with LLM Agents: Opportunities and Challenges." Preprint, August 7. https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07132. (Image #8, Image #9).  In fig-topic-07-active-learning that is indeed a visualization of active learning idea, but how is that actually contextualized for our concept of music attribution, and how could we envision active learning to help at the "backend" of intelligent attribution annotation system? How are we saving the time of the artist or any other human interfacing with the system? With our agentic UI that learns from user behavior via Posthog or something. Save my prompt verbatim to /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/docs/planning/nano-banana-pro-figure-improvement.md and plan with reviewer agents how to improve the figure plans! And make sure that we don't write 1px or font selection to the figure itself, make clear that these are internal instructions
