## Certification Bodies

### Fairly Trained

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Website** | [fairlytrained.org](https://www.fairlytrained.org/) |
| **Founded by** | Ed Newton-Rex (resigned as VP Audio at Stability AI, Nov 2023, over "fair use" disagreement) |
| **Founder background** | Created Jukedeck (acquired by ByteDance); Product Director at TikTok AI Lab; CPO at Voisey (acquired by Snap) |
| **Recognition** | TIME 100 Most Influential People in AI 2025 (Newton-Rex) |
| **Mission** | "Certify fair training data use in Generative AI" |
| **Twitter** | [@fairlytrained](https://twitter.com/fairlytrained) |

**Core requirement**: Companies must get a license for their training data. Fairly Trained certifies "AI companies that don't use any copyrighted work without a license." Models relying on a "fair use" exception are explicitly disqualified.

**Consumer framing**: "Consumers deserve to know which companies think creator consent is important."

#### Certification Criteria

**Current level**: Licensed Model (L) Certification — one tier only.

**Scope options**: Applicants can certify at three granularity levels: entire company, single product/service, or individual model.

**Permissible training data sources** (must fall into one of four categories):
1. Explicitly provided under contractual agreement for training
2. Available under an appropriate open license
3. In the public domain globally
4. Fully owned by the model developer

**Process**: Online application → written submission with training data details → submission fee → review → annual certification fee → annual re-evaluation.

**Pricing** (scaled by revenue):

| Revenue Tier | Submission Fee | Annual Fee |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Under $100K | $100-150 | $250-500 |
| Under $500K | $150 | $1,000 |
| Higher tiers | Up to ~$500 | Up to ~$6,000 |

## Licensing Programs

### LANDR — Fair Trade AI Program

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Website** | [landr.com](https://www.landr.com/) |
| **Core business** | AI mastering, music distribution, collaboration tools |
| **AI mastering engine** | "Synapse" — continuously refined by human engineers |

**Fair Trade AI model** (launched July 2024):
- Artists opt-in to contribute their distributed tracks (must have full recording and publishing rights)
- Revenue share = (your contributed seconds / total dataset seconds) x 20% of ALL net revenue from AI products using the dataset
- Monthly payouts to LANDR account; opt-out available at any time
- Music remains 100% artist-owned
- LANDR stated no plans to sell/license raw dataset to other AI music companies
- **Advantages**: Predictable revenue; transparent terms; scalable
- **Criticism**: Some question whether 20% is genuinely "fair" given dilution across large numbers of contributors

**Human-in-the-loop**: LANDR's Synapse engine responds to user feedback via "Mastering Revisions." Human engineers continuously tweak and refine the algorithm.

**Philosophy**: "AI works best for musicians when it's used to assist and empower the creative process rather than replace it."

### Lemonaide (Acquired by BeatStars, Jan 2026)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Certification** | Fairly Trained certified |
| **Focus** | MIDI generation, artist-focused tools |
| **Status** | **Acquired by BeatStars (January 2026)** — now building "the world's first ethical, creator-owned AI music ecosystem" |

**Attribution approach**: Multi-tiered:
- **Collab Club models**: Each AI model trained exclusively on a single producer's data, with 100% attribution flowing to that producer
- **Named producer models**: Multi-platinum producers including Lex Luger, Kato On The Track, DJ Pain 1, Mantra, KXVI have individual models
- **Broader dataset contributions**: Simpler pro-rata splits
- Investing in more granular "fractional attribution" for the future

**Post-acquisition**: BeatStars Rights tools help independent music makers manage their rights. "Every element used in an AI-assisted production can be registered, tracked, managed, and monetized at scale." Creators who train models continue to receive ownership in outputs.

**Philosophical stance**: Producer-centric. Models resemble specific producers with explicit consent, transparent attribution, and compensation baked in.

### Source Audio / SongLab

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Catalog** | 33M+ tracks (world's largest opt-in AI music dataset) |
| **Songwriters** | 446,000 |
| **Publishers** | 116,000 |
| **Full mixes** | 14M (3.2M with vocals) |
| **Alternate versions/stems** | 19M |
| **Key hire** | Drew Silverstein (Amper Music co-founder/former CEO) as President, Head of AI Strategy |
| **Revenue to rights holders** | $1.35M+ new ARR for opted-in rights holders (as of mid-2025) |

**Approach**: Upfront compensation built directly into license terms, rather than ongoing per-use royalty attribution. Revenue distributed transparently — either upfront or over the agreement term. "One-stop shop" controlling both master and publishing rights — can move quickly without complex approval chains.

**Partnership with Musical AI**: Added output attribution capability to the dataset marketplace — Musical AI's technology traces which training data influences specific outputs and identifies percentage contributions.

**Partnership with Wondera**: Licensed 14M+ tracks for Wondera's ethical AI music generation platform, with opt-in rights for artists and transparent revenue sharing.

Per Water & Music: "Entities controlling both master and publishing rights have substantial advantages in the AI training market." Source Audio exemplifies this advantage.

### Human Native AI (Acquired by Cloudflare, Jan 2026)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Status** | **Acquired by Cloudflare (January 15, 2026)** |
| **Prior funding** | $3.56M over 2 rounds from 5 investors |
| **Mission** | Getting Generative AI out of its "Napster era" |

**What they built**: Data licensing platform connecting content suppliers (including audio/music rights holders) with AI developers. Provided technical integration for secure content exchange, streamlined legal agreements, IP protection, market intelligence for fair pricing, and custom dataset creation from rights-cleared content.

**Post-acquisition**: Cloudflare is building a system where AI developers pay creators for content used to train models, leveraging Human Native's marketplace infrastructure. Their platform indexed, cleaned, normalized, and structured text, audio, video, and other media for AI training.

**Assessment**: The Cloudflare acquisition validates the data licensing broker model. The infrastructure will now operate at Cloudflare's scale, potentially becoming the default content licensing layer for AI companies using Cloudflare's CDN and AI gateway.

## Rights Organizations & Registries

### SoundExchange AI Registry

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Announced** | September 2024 |
| **Expected launch** | Q1 2025 |
| **Type** | Global ISRC-based registry |
| **Basis** | Evolution of SoundExchange's royalty distribution systems |

**Purpose**: Rights holders can "reserve" rights against AI training. AI companies can reference the database before ingesting recordings.

**Key features**:
- Voluntary tool — rights maintained regardless of listing
- Supplements individual reservations with economies of scale
- Global scope (including EU protections)
- Based on authoritative ISRC database

**Significance for our scaffold**: If widely adopted, this becomes the canonical opt-in/opt-out database. Our MCP permission server should be designed to query this registry.
