# Final QA Deep Code Review — User Prompt (Verbatim)

> fetch the remote and Let's do final branch/PR main for this v1.0 and for the frozen Zenodo submission. Create fix/qa-final-check branch, and let's run deep code review with multiple reviewer agents addressing the suboptimal code patterns, anti-patterns, etc. Make sure that everything is decoupled as possible with single-source config definitions, both backend and frontend as Claude Code has this tendency to create duplicate code and parts of codes easily override some upstream config, and it becomes a nightmare trying to edit the codebase as Claude Code was not aware of the previous code or did not bother to adhere to the config, prompt, data, code, decoupling for software best practicies. Save my prompt verbatim, and let's start the deep exploration with the report written to /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/code-review-final-qa-report.md and then address the shortcoming with TDD and multiple reviewers agent then verifying the fixes in true Ralph Wiggum manner (/home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/.claude/skills/self-learning-iterative-coder) until no issues can be detected! Be as thorough as possible and let's do quality work and always address the root cause of issues, without token-saving reactive whac-a-moling!
