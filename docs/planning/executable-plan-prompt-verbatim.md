After all this domain-specific landscape let's design then an action plan /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/docs/planning/probabilistic-prd-executable-plan.xml that is crash-resistant full-context action plan with progress tracking and as non-ambiguous instruction following with it as possible! It should be obviously now be based on the research today /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/docs/planning/music-tech-landscape
/home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/docs/planning/probabilistic-prd-tool-landscape.md

/home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/docs/planning/probabilistic-prd-design.md
/home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/docs/planning/probablistic-prd.md and don't forget this AI-created gap analysis: /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/docs/prd/UNKNOWNS-FOR-DOMAIN-EXPERTS.md. The action plan should now plan what implementations would make sense to be implemented in TDD/Evals-driven fashion. What are the lowest-hanging infrastructure to be actually developed in code (rather than .md PRD files)? We should think of this Prefect (or Celery) type of decoupling of different pipelines for better division of labor and management of very different tasks! For example if we have "We have access to large libraries of information about music works. Discogs, musicbrains, Auracles own and the likes. We would like to find a method to take all of these data sets, cross reference them and present to the artist most likely data that is 90 to 100% confident is correct." and there is some ETL pipeline preprocessing the Discogs/Musicbrains data with some periodicity in a Prefect flow so that the person who is developing the analysis code for the code does not have to care how the data is processed as long as the person knows the "handover schema" from the "data engineering pipeline". And what tools we need there then for the handover? Pydantic, Great Expectations, OpenMetadata, DVC, etc. "**Internal Reproducibility & Lineage Cards**

* **Environment Cards**: Language versions, containers
* **Schema Evolution Cards**: Pydantic/OpenMetadata diff tracking ([Raschka et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09315))
* **Prompt Cards**: Version control for prompt templates ([Liu et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07350))
* **Deployment Lineage Cards**: Git SHA \+ DVC tag \+ CI/CD metadata ([DVC CML](https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/ci-cd-for-machine-learning)), [OpenLineage](https://openlineage.io/) useful?
* **Reproducibility Checklist Card**: Seed settings, configs, test harness ([Joelle et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12691))". How do we sure that everything is made reproducible internally so that software engineers have an excellent DevEx then? The multi-agentic workflow need to work both in agentic sense, and for the human engineers to work efficiently together! Self-reflect on this from https://www.linkedin.com/in/emollick?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAAGUakBGLMO02LmS5BwXexrsKODQQpx2qI&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3BbhjV9hS4S%2F2y70wrSpBJ9Q%3D%3D : "I think agentic AI would work much better if people took lessons from organizational theory, which has actually spent a lot of time understanding how to deal with complex hierarchies, information limits, and spans of control.

Right now most agentic AI systems seem to pretend that models have basically unlimited ability to manage subagents when that is clearly not true. We need measures of spans of control for AI. A human tops out at less than 10 direct reports. I am pretty sure that 100 subagents is too much for an orchestrator agent - suspect we need middle management agents (yes, I get it, insert middle management joke here).

Similarly, we need more attention to boundary objects. These are what is handed between groups (marketing to IT to sales) in organizations to convey meaning as a project crosses group boundaries, like a prototype or a user story. Right now agents pass raw text & maybe code back and forth. Structured boundary objects that multiple agents of different ability levels can read and write to would solve a huge number of coordination failures & reduce token use.

I also think aboht coupling, which is how tightly units inside organizations are bound. Most agentic systems are either too tightly coupled (every step needs approval) or too loose (Moltbook). This tradeoff is well-studied in organizations, I bet a lot would apply to agents. Other known issues like bounded rationality also apply, I suspect.

Everyone is rushing towards the (terribly named) agent swarm, but the issue won't just be how good the model is, it will be org design choices. I am not sure the labs see this, but we definitely need a lot more experiments with organizing agents done by people who understand real coordination issues." and we should definitely explore Anthropic's Agent Swarms here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46743908 but think of the division of labor organizational structure: https://gist.github.com/kieranklaassen/4f2aba89594a4aea4ad64d753984b2ea . And remember that these are the two key arxiv papers that we could use as inspiration for the music application that we should be doing then: Morreale, Fabio, Wiebke Hutiri, Joan Serrà, Alice Xiang, and Yuki Mitsufuji. 2025. "Attribution-by-Design: Ensuring Inference-Time Provenance in Generative Music Systems." arXiv:2510.08062. Preprint, arXiv, October 9. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.08062. Kim, Wonil, Hyeongseok Wi, Seungsoon Park, et al. 2025. "From Generation to Attribution: Music AI Agent Architectures for the Post-Streaming Era." arXiv:2510.20276.

 as in what all the domain-agnostic "graph RAG MVA infrastrucutre" should support for this music attribution case (re-read this whitepaper again here: /home/petteri/Dropbox/github-personal/music-attribution-scaffold/docs/sources/soundverse-2025-ethical-framework-ai-music-infrastructure.md) Let's iterate on the .xml plan with reviewer agents until we converge into a perfect plan!
