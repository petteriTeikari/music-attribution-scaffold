# Solo Musician MVP Scenario
#
# A single musician with basic coding skills building an attribution
# tool for their own catalog. Maximum simplicity, zero ops.

scenario_id: solo_musician_mvp
title: "Solo Musician MVP"
description: >
  A musician who can code (or has a developer friend) building an
  attribution verification tool for their own catalog of 50-500 tracks.
  Every choice is filtered through "can one non-engineer maintain this?"

archetype: musician_first_team
domain: music_attribution

resolved_decisions:
  # L1 Business
  build_vs_buy_posture: saas_maximalist        # Minimize custom code
  target_market_segment: independent_creators  # Serving themselves and peers
  revenue_model: freemium_saas                 # Free tier for personal use
  regulatory_posture: best_effort              # No compliance overhead

  # L2 Architecture
  data_model_complexity: simple_relational     # Foreign keys and join tables
  api_protocol: rest_openapi                   # Most accessible protocol
  service_decomposition: monolith              # Single deployable
  ai_framework_strategy: lightweight_sdk       # instructor/mirascope for convenience

  # L3 Implementation
  primary_database: supabase                   # All-in-one backend
  graph_strategy: sql_joins_only               # No graph infrastructure
  vector_strategy: no_vector_search            # Fuzzy string matching
  llm_provider: openai_primary                 # Most tutorials available
  frontend_framework: nextjs                   # Templates and tutorials
  auth_strategy: supabase_auth                 # Bundled with Supabase

  # L4 Deployment
  compute_platform: vercel_plus_backend        # Vercel for Next.js frontend
  database_hosting: supabase_hosted            # Bundled Supabase experience
  ci_cd_pipeline: platform_native_autodeploy   # Git push deploys
  iac_tooling: none_manual                     # Dashboard configuration
  container_strategy: buildpacks               # Auto-detect, no Docker

  # L5 Operations
  observability_stack: minimal_logging         # Platform dashboards
  scaling_strategy: vertical_only              # Handles 500 tracks easily
  backup_dr_strategy: managed_provider_backups # Supabase daily backups
  secrets_management: environment_variables    # Platform env vars

joint_probability: 0.0023
# Higher joint probability than engineer-heavy scenario because musician-first
# archetype has stronger preferences (more concentrated distributions).

rationale: >
  This scenario represents the minimum viable attribution tool: Supabase
  handles everything (database, auth, real-time), Vercel serves the Next.js
  frontend, and the musician never touches a terminal. The trade-off is
  capability ceiling — no graph queries, no vector search, no MCP.

  For a catalog of 500 tracks with mostly correct metadata that needs
  verification, this is more than sufficient.

trade_offs:
  gains:
    - "Zero operational burden"
    - "Fully free tier deployment possible"
    - "Visual admin via Supabase dashboard"
    - "Auth built-in (social logins, magic links)"
    - "Real-time updates for collaborative editing"
  sacrifices:
    - "No graph-based attribution network analysis"
    - "No embedding-based entity resolution"
    - "No MCP protocol (not serving AI platforms)"
    - "Supabase vendor lock-in"
    - "Limited to Supabase extension availability"
    - "No infrastructure-as-code"
