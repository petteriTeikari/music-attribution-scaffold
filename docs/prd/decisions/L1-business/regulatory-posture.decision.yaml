# Regulatory Posture

# How proactively the system addresses regulatory compliance.
# Influences security architecture, audit logging depth, and
# deployment topology (data residency).

decision_id: regulatory_posture
title: "Regulatory Posture"
description: >
  Determines the team's approach to regulatory compliance. Ranges from
  "best-effort" (do the minimum, address compliance when customers demand it)
  to "compliance-first" (build compliance into the architecture from day one).
  This decision has strong implications for infrastructure costs, development
  velocity, and addressable market segments.

  Key regulations: EU AI Act (transparency, risk classification),
  GDPR (data residency, right to erasure), DSA (platform obligations),
  and sector-specific rules (music: collective management directives;
  DPP: EU ESPR digital product passport mandates).

options:
  - option_id: best_effort
    title: "Best Effort"
    description: >
      Minimal compliance work. Focus on product-market fit first.
      Address regulatory requirements reactively when customers
      or markets demand it. Acceptable for pre-revenue MVPs.
    prior_probability: 0.30
    status: viable
    constraints:
      - "Not targeting enterprise/regulated customers initially"
      - "Acceptance of compliance debt"

  - option_id: compliance_aware
    title: "Compliance Aware"
    description: >
      Design with compliance in mind but don't over-invest.
      Implement audit logging, basic data residency controls,
      and consent management. Address specific regulations when
      entering relevant markets.
    prior_probability: 0.40
    status: recommended
    constraints:
      - "Audit logging infrastructure"
      - "Basic consent management"
      - "Data classification awareness"

  - option_id: compliance_first
    title: "Compliance First"
    description: >
      Build regulatory compliance into the architecture from day one.
      SOC2 certification path, GDPR-by-design, EU AI Act risk
      classification, comprehensive audit trails. Required for
      enterprise and rights organization customers.
    prior_probability: 0.30
    status: viable
    constraints:
      - "Dedicated compliance/legal resource"
      - "Higher infrastructure costs (audit storage, encryption)"
      - "Slower development velocity"

rationale: >
  The "compliance aware" middle ground gets the highest prior because most
  teams in the attribution/traceability space recognize regulatory relevance
  but cannot justify full compliance investment pre-PMF. The volatile
  classification reflects rapid regulatory evolution in 2026.
