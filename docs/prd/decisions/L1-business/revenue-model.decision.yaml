# Revenue Model
#
# How the system generates revenue. Tightly coupled with target market
# segment and influences infrastructure cost tolerance.

decision_id: revenue_model
title: "Revenue Model"
description: >
  Defines the primary monetization strategy. This decision interacts
  strongly with target market segment (enterprise customers expect
  different pricing than independent creators) and influences downstream
  infrastructure decisions (API metering requires different observability
  than flat-rate subscriptions).

options:
  - option_id: freemium_saas
    title: "Freemium SaaS"
    description: >
      Free tier for basic attribution (limited tracks/queries),
      paid tiers for advanced features (bulk operations, API access,
      priority support). Classic PLG (product-led growth) model.
    prior_probability: 0.35
    status: recommended
    constraints:
      - "Must sustain free tier infrastructure costs"
      - "Clear value differentiation between tiers"
      - "Self-service upgrade path"

  - option_id: api_usage_metered
    title: "API Usage Metered"
    description: >
      Pay-per-query or tiered API access. Primary revenue from
      AI platforms and integration partners. Requires robust
      metering and billing infrastructure.
    prior_probability: 0.25
    status: viable
    constraints:
      - "API metering infrastructure required"
      - "Billing integration (Stripe metered billing)"
      - "Rate limiting and abuse prevention"

  - option_id: enterprise_licensing
    title: "Enterprise Licensing"
    description: >
      Annual contracts with rights organizations and major labels.
      Custom pricing, SLAs, dedicated support. High revenue per
      customer but long sales cycles.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: viable
    constraints:
      - "Sales team or founder-led sales"
      - "Contract management infrastructure"
      - "SOC2 or equivalent compliance"

  - option_id: open_core
    title: "Open Core"
    description: >
      Core attribution engine is open-source. Revenue from hosted
      service (managed version), enterprise features (SSO, audit
      logs, SLAs), and support contracts. Builds community and trust.
    prior_probability: 0.25
    status: viable
    constraints:
      - "Clear boundary between open and commercial features"
      - "Community management effort"
      - "Dual licensing considerations"
