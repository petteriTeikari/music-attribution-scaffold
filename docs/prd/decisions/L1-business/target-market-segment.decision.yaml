# Target Market Segment
#
# Who is the primary user of this system? The answer shapes UX complexity,
# compliance requirements, pricing strategy, and technical architecture.

decision_id: target_market_segment
title: "Target Market Segment"
description: >
  Defines the primary user persona and market segment the system serves.
  This decision influences API design (simple vs. enterprise), compliance
  requirements (self-service vs. SOC2), and UX complexity (wizard vs.
  power-user interface). Secondary segments can be served later, but the
  primary segment drives MVP priorities.

  - option_id: mid_tier_labels
    title: "Mid-tier Labels & Publishers"
    description: >
      Labels with 10-100 artists and 1K-50K tracks. Need bulk
      operations, team access, and integration with existing
      royalty systems. Willing to pay $100-500/month.
    prior_probability: 0.30
    status: viable

  - option_id: enterprise_rights_orgs
    title: "Enterprise / Rights Organizations"
    description: >
      Major labels, PROs (ASCAP, BMI, PRS), CMOs. Need enterprise
      security, SLAs, custom integrations, and regulatory compliance.
      Catalog size: 100K+ tracks. Budget: $5K+/month.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: viable

    description: >
      AI companies (training data licensing), streaming services
      (metadata enrichment), music tech startups (API consumers).
      Primary interaction via MCP/API, not UI. Need high throughput
      and machine-readable permissions.
    prior_probability: 0.20
    status: viable
    constraints:

rationale: >
  Prior probabilities reflect the addressable market for attribution systems.
  Independent creators are the largest group but hardest to monetize.
  Mid-tier labels are the sweet spot for early traction. Enterprise and
  AI consumers represent high-value but harder-to-reach segments.
