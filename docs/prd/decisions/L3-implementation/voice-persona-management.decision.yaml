# Voice Persona Management
#
# Determines how the voice agent's audible persona is created,
# managed, and deployed — from generic TTS to artist voice cloning.

decision_id: voice_persona_management
title: "Voice Persona Management"
description: >
  Selects the approach for managing the voice agent's audible identity.
  Ranges from using a stock TTS voice to cloning a specific artist's
  voice for digital twin scenarios. Artist voice cloning requires
  consent infrastructure aligned with NO FAKES Act (2025) and GEMA
  AI Charter requirements. Voice adds a 10-50x cost multiplier over
  text ($0.028-0.164/minute vs $0.001-0.01/turn), making the choice
  a significant FinOps decision. Phase strategy recommended: system
  voice (Phase I-III), ElevenLabs clone (Phase IV), on-device Sesame
  as costs scale.

options:
  - option_id: system_voice_only
    title: "System TTS Voice"
    description: >
      Generic, high-quality TTS from Cartesia or Deepgram. No cloning,
      no consent complexity, lowest cost (~$0.04/minute). Professional
      and accessible. Acceptable for Phase I-III where voice is an
      interface modality, not a brand identity. Select voice by
      warmth, clarity, and cultural neutrality.

  - option_id: artist_clone_managed
    title: "Artist Voice Clone (ElevenLabs Professional)"
    description: >
      ElevenLabs Professional Voice Cloning for artist-specific digital
      twins. ~$0.08-0.12/minute TTS cost. Requires artist consent
      (NILV infrastructure aligned with NO FAKES Act). High-fidelity
      voice replication. Revenue share model possible if third-party
      usage enabled. Best for Premium/Pro tier differentiation.
    prior_probability: 0.25
    status: viable
    constraints:
      - "Requires explicit artist consent (NO FAKES Act compliance)"
      - "Higher per-minute TTS cost ($0.08-0.12/min)"

  - option_id: artist_clone_open_source
    title: "Artist Voice Clone (Sesame CSM / Open Source)"
    description: >
      Self-hosted voice cloning using Sesame CSM or Orpheus TTS.
      Apache 2.0 licensed, no per-minute API cost after infrastructure
      investment. Requires GPU hosting. Lower fidelity than ElevenLabs
      but improving rapidly. Best for cost optimization at scale
      (30+ min/day power users where managed API costs are prohibitive).
    prior_probability: 0.10
    status: experimental
    constraints:
      - "Requires GPU infrastructure for inference"
      - "Lower voice fidelity than managed alternatives (as of Feb 2026)"
      - "Same consent requirements as managed cloning"
    complements:

  - option_id: none_text_only
    title: "No Voice (Text-Only Fallback)"
    description: >
      Voice as premium feature; text-only default. Voice UI surfaces
      exist but show "Upgrade to Pro" upsell. Zero voice infrastructure
      cost. Appropriate for teams that cannot yet invest in voice
      pipeline or where target users are primarily text-oriented
      (API consumers, enterprise batch operations).
