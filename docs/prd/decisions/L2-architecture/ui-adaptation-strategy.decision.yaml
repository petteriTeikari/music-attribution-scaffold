# UI Adaptation Strategy
#
# Architectural pattern for how the frontend adapts its layout,
# complexity, and information density based on user context.

decision_id: ui_adaptation_strategy
title: "UI Adaptation Strategy"
description: >
  Defines the architectural approach for adapting the user interface
  to different user proficiency levels, task contexts, and confidence
  states. Ranges from fixed layouts to AI-driven malleable interfaces
  that co-evolve with user behavior. Key for music attribution where
  users span from solo artists to label administrators, each needing
  different levels of detail and control.

    description: >
      AI adapts UI layout, field visibility, and information density
      based on user proficiency signals, task context, and attribution
      confidence levels. Co-evolutionary loop: explicit feedback
      (thumbs up/down, field corrections) and implicit signals
      (hover time, field expansion frequency) drive adaptation.
      Red/Yellow/Green confidence-based field prioritization.

    status: recommended

  - option_id: configurable_presets
    title: "User-Configurable Presets"
    description: >
      Predefined UI modes (e.g., Simple/Standard/Expert/Admin)
      that users select manually. Each preset shows/hides fields
      and adjusts detail level. No AI-driven adaptation, but
      users can switch between views.
    prior_probability: 0.30
    status: viable

  - option_id: progressive_disclosure
    title: "Progressive Disclosure"
    description: >
      Static progressive disclosure pattern. Summary view by
      default, with expandable sections for details. No
      personalization — same experience for all users. Simplest
      to implement and test.
    prior_probability: 0.25
    status: viable

  - option_id: fixed_layout
    title: "Fixed Layout"
    description: >
      Single fixed layout for all users. Dashboard-style with
      all information visible. May overwhelm new users but
      ensures consistent experience and simplest maintenance.
    prior_probability: 0.15
