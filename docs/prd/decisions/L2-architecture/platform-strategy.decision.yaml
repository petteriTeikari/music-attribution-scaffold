# Platform Strategy
#
# Whether the scaffold evolves as a standalone tool, an integration
# platform with developer APIs, or positions for acquisition.

description: >
  Determines the scaffold's strategic positioning in the music attribution
  ecosystem. A standalone tool focuses on end-user UX and self-contained
  functionality. An integration platform exposes developer APIs and enables
  third-party extensions. An acquisition target focuses on defensible IP
  and demonstrable technology differentiation.

options:
  - option_id: standalone_tool
    title: "Standalone Tool"
    description: >
      Focus on end-user experience. The scaffold is a self-contained
      application that users interact with directly. Investment goes into
      UX polish, documentation, and community building. Revenue comes from
      usage (freemium/subscription).

  - option_id: integration_platform
    title: "Integration Platform"
    description: >
      Expose developer APIs and extension points. The scaffold becomes
      infrastructure that other tools build on. Investment goes into API
      design, SDKs, and developer experience. Revenue comes from API
      usage and marketplace fees.

  - option_id: acquisition_target
    title: "Acquisition Target"
    description: >
      Focus on defensible IP and technology demonstration. The scaffold
      showcases novel attribution approaches (probabilistic PRD, Bayesian
      confidence, MCP consent infrastructure) to attract acquirer interest.
      Investment goes into patents, benchmarks, and academic publications.

  The standalone vs platform decision is the most consequential strategic
  choice after MVP. Standalone tools can iterate faster but face
  distribution challenges. Platforms create network effects but require
  10x more API surface maintenance. Acquisition positioning is a valid
  strategy for research-heavy projects with novel IP but limited
  go-to-market resources.

    rationale: "Enterprise segments favor platform; indie creators favor standalone tool"
  - from: revenue_model
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Revenue model constrains viable platform strategies"
