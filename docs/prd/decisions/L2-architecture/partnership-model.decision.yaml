description: >
  Determines the engagement model for external partnerships. API marketplace
  offers broad but shallow integrations. Strategic alliance provides deep
  integration with selected partners. CMO federation creates institutional
  infrastructure for collective management organizations.

options:
  - option_id: api_marketplace
    title: "API Marketplace"
    description: >
      Broad integration surface. The scaffold provides APIs that any
      partner can consume. Standardized data formats, self-service
      onboarding, usage-based billing. Maximizes breadth but limits
      depth of any single integration.

  - option_id: strategic_alliance
    title: "Strategic Alliance"
    description: >
      Deep integration with selected partners. Bilateral data exchange
      agreements, custom integration work, shared roadmap alignment.
      Requires significant business development but creates defensible
      relationships and unique data advantages.

  - option_id: cmo_federated
    title: "CMO Federated"
    description: >
      Institutional infrastructure serving collective management
      organizations. Federation protocol for cross-CMO data sharing,
      licensing decision support, and compliance reporting. Highest
      complexity but addresses the largest addressable market (global
      music rights management).

research_notes: >
  The partnership model must align with platform strategy. Standalone
  tools favor API marketplace (low integration overhead). Integration
  platforms favor strategic alliances (deep technical partnerships).
  CMO federation is the most ambitious path but addresses the institutional
  gap in AI music licensing infrastructure that STIM's pilot has exposed.

    rationale: "Enterprise/CMO segments favor federation; indie creators favor marketplace"

    rationale: "Revenue model determines partnership economics"
  - from: regulatory_posture
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Compliance requirements drive institutional partnership needs"
