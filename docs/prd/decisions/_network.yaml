# Probabilistic PRD Decision Network Topology
#
# DAG adjacency list defining all decision nodes and directed edges.
# Edges flow from parent → child (upstream → downstream influence).
# Used for visualization, acyclicity validation, and traversal.
#
# Invariants:
#   - Graph must be acyclic (no circular dependencies)
#   - All node.id values must match decision_id in corresponding .decision.yaml
#   - All edge endpoints must reference declared nodes
#   - Edge direction: from (parent) → to (child)

network:
  name: "Probabilistic PRD Decision Network"
  version: "2.2.0"
  last_updated: 2026-02-14
  description: >
    Bayesian decision network for the Music Attribution Scaffold.
    5-level hierarchy (L1 Business → L5 Operations) with conditional
    probability edges encoding how upstream choices influence downstream options.
    v2.2.0: Added mcp_security_strategy (L3), mcp_production_deployment (L3),
    mcp_input_validation (L4) nodes based on MCP security research synthesis.
    v2.1.0: Added object_storage node (L4), corrected Hetzner complexity
    (bare-metal ≠ simple), promoted Pulumi over Terraform, expanded FinOps
    with DevOps tax framework and cloud credit strategy.
