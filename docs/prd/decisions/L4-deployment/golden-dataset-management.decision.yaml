# Golden Dataset Management
#
# How gold-standard attribution datasets are created, versioned, and maintained.

decision_id: golden_dataset_management
title: "Golden Dataset Management"
description: >
  Determines the management approach for gold-standard attribution datasets
  used in evaluation and regression testing. These datasets contain manually
  verified attribution records against which the scaffold's automated
  attribution is benchmarked.

options:
  - option_id: manual_curation
    title: "Manual Curation"
    description: >
      Gold datasets curated manually in Git-tracked JSON/YAML files.
      Simple version control but limited scale and no automated
      quality validation.
    prior_probability: 0.40
    status: candidate

  - option_id: versioned_dvc
    title: "Versioned with DVC"
    description: >
      Gold datasets managed with DVC (Data Version Control) alongside
      code. Enables dataset versioning, reproducibility, and CI
      integration. Datasets stored in object storage with metadata
      in Git.
    prior_probability: 0.40
    status: selected

  - option_id: automated
    title: "Automated Curation"
    description: >
      Semi-automated gold dataset creation with human-in-the-loop
      validation. The system proposes new gold records based on high-
      confidence attributions; humans approve or reject.
    prior_probability: 0.20
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  Gold datasets are critical for the attribution_eval_framework node.
  Without gold-standard data, accuracy metrics are meaningless. DVC
  provides the best balance of version control and scalability for
  ML datasets. The Imogen Heap mock data (8 works, 0.0-0.95 confidence)
  serves as the initial gold dataset seed.
