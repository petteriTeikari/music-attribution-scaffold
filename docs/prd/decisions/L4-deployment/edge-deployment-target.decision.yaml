# Edge Deployment Target
#
# Which edge platform to target if edge inference is adopted.

decision_id: edge_deployment_target
title: "Edge Deployment Target"
description: >
  Determines the target platform for edge inference deployment, if the
  edge_inference_strategy selects an edge option. Each platform has
  different runtime constraints, pricing models, and integration patterns.

decision_level: L4_deployment
status: stub
last_updated: 2026-02-14

options:
  - option_id: no_edge
    title: "No Edge Deployment"
    description: >
      No edge deployment. All processing runs on the central server.
      Default when edge_inference_strategy selects server-only.
    prior_probability: 0.50
    status: selected

  - option_id: cloudflare_workers
    title: "Cloudflare Workers"
    description: >
      Deploy edge functions on Cloudflare Workers with Workers AI for
      inference. Global edge network, V8 runtime, pay-per-request
      pricing. Good for lightweight fingerprint computation.
    prior_probability: 0.25
    status: candidate

  - option_id: deno_deploy
    title: "Deno Deploy"
    description: >
      Deploy on Deno Deploy with built-in KV storage. V8 runtime with
      TypeScript-first development. Good for metadata extraction and
      caching.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: candidate

  - option_id: supabase_edge
    title: "Supabase Edge Functions"
    description: >
      Deploy via Supabase Edge Functions (Deno-based) with direct
      PostgreSQL access. Tightest database integration but Supabase-
      specific lock-in.
    prior_probability: 0.10
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  Edge deployment only relevant if edge_inference_strategy selects a
  non-server-only option. Cloudflare Workers AI supports 100+ models
  including audio processing. Deno Deploy is simpler but less
  AI-focused. Supabase Edge Functions provide database integration
  but create Supabase dependency.

influences:
  - from: edge_inference_strategy
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Edge strategy determines whether deployment is needed"
  - from: compute_platform
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Central compute platform creates edge platform affinity"
