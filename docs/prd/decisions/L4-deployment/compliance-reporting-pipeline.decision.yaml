research_notes: >
  EU AI Act GPAI obligations enforceable from August 2025. Art. 12
  requires audit trails for AI system decisions. GPAI Code of Practice
  (July 2025) provides voluntary guidance on copyright compliance.
  Penalties reach EUR 35M or 7% global turnover. Most startups will
  start semi-automated and invest in full automation as regulatory
  requirements solidify.
