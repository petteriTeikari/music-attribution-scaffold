# EthicsOps & Governance-as-Code
#
# Automated ethics review and governance for attribution systems.

decision_id: ethics_governance
title: "EthicsOps & Governance-as-Code"
description: >
  Determines the approach to systematic ethics review and governance
  documentation for attribution and confidence scoring systems. Music
  attribution directly affects artist livelihoods — miscalibrated confidence
  scores or biased entity resolution can cause real financial harm. This
  decision covers model cards, calibration audits, and governance workflows.

options:
  - option_id: none
    title: "No Formal Governance"
    description: >
      Ethics considerations handled ad-hoc through code review and team
      discussion. No structured documentation of model behavior, bias
      analysis, or calibration audits. Acceptable for early-stage internal
      tooling with limited external impact.

  - option_id: model_cards
    title: "Model Cards + Calibration Docs"
    description: >
      Publish model cards (Mitchell et al., 2019) for each attribution
      component documenting intended use, limitations, bias analysis, and
      performance metrics. Include conformal prediction calibration reports
      showing coverage guarantees and confidence interval accuracy. Maps
      directly to A0-A3 assurance level documentation requirements.

          and performance across demographic groups.

          Model cards extended with conformal prediction calibration
          reports, coverage probability audits, and A0-A3 assurance
          level compliance documentation.

  - option_id: full_governance
    title: "Full Governance Framework"
    description: >
      Comprehensive governance-as-code: model cards, automated bias testing
      in CI, calibration regression tests, ethics review board workflow
      (GitHub issue template + approval gates), data lineage documentation,
      and EU AI Act compliance artifacts. Significant overhead but provides
      defensible governance posture for regulated markets.
    prior_probability: 0.30
    status: viable
    constraints:
      - "Dedicated governance staffing or rotating review duty"
      - "CI pipeline time increase for bias/calibration checks"
      - "Template and workflow maintenance overhead"
