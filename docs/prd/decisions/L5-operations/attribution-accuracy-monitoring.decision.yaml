# Attribution Accuracy Monitoring
#
# Ongoing monitoring of attribution accuracy in production.

decision_id: attribution_accuracy_monitoring
title: "Attribution Accuracy Monitoring"
description: >
  Determines how attribution accuracy is monitored over time in
  production. Options range from manual spot-checking to continuous
  automated monitoring with drift detection.

options:
  - option_id: manual_spot
    title: "Manual Spot-Check"
    description: >
      Periodic manual review of attribution results against known-good
      data. Ad-hoc schedule, human judgment for quality assessment.
    prior_probability: 0.35
    status: candidate

  - option_id: periodic_eval
    title: "Periodic Evaluation"
    description: >
      Scheduled evaluation runs against gold-standard datasets with
      automated scoring and regression alerts. Weekly or monthly
      cadence. Dashboard for trend visualization.
    prior_probability: 0.45
    status: selected

  - option_id: continuous
    title: "Continuous Monitoring"
    description: >
      Real-time monitoring of attribution confidence distributions,
      data source availability, and model performance metrics. Alerts
      on drift detection and anomaly signals.
    prior_probability: 0.20
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  The scaffold's DriftDetector cross-cutting concern provides the
  foundation for continuous monitoring. Periodic evaluation against
  gold datasets is the practical middle ground — catching regressions
  without the infrastructure overhead of real-time monitoring. The
  attribution_eval_framework provides the evaluation tooling;
  this node covers the operational scheduling and alerting.
