research_notes: >
  EU AI Act GPAI enforcement from August 2025 is the most immediate
  regulatory pressure. The GPAI Code of Practice (July 2025) provides
  voluntary guidance. Digital Omnibus delays push comprehensive reform
  to late 2026+. National implementations vary across EU member states.
  For a research project, alert subscriptions provide the best
  cost/coverage balance.
