# Partnership Health Metrics
#
# Monitoring the health and SLA compliance of external partnerships.

decision_id: partnership_health_metrics
title: "Partnership Health Metrics"
description: >
  Determines how the health of external partnerships and API integrations
  is monitored. As the scaffold adds integration points (SoundExchange,
  Sureel, MusicBrainz, etc.), monitoring API availability and data
  quality becomes operationally important.

options:
  - option_id: no_monitoring
    title: "No Dedicated Monitoring"
    description: >
      No dedicated partnership monitoring. API failures surface through
      application error handling and user reports. Acceptable for
      research/pre-production.
    prior_probability: 0.40
    status: selected

  - option_id: basic_uptime
    title: "Basic Uptime Monitoring"
    description: >
      Monitor API endpoint availability and response latency for each
      integration partner. Alerts on downtime or degraded performance.
      Standard health check approach.
    prior_probability: 0.40
    status: candidate

  - option_id: full_sla
    title: "Full SLA Monitoring"
    description: >
      Comprehensive SLA monitoring including uptime, latency percentiles,
      data freshness, error rates, and data quality metrics. SLA
      dashboards per partner with escalation procedures.
    prior_probability: 0.20
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  Partnership monitoring becomes critical when the scaffold transitions
  from research to production. Current integrations (MusicBrainz API)
  have no SLA and occasionally rate-limit. Future integrations
  (SoundExchange, Sureel) may have contractual SLAs requiring monitoring.
  Basic uptime monitoring is the minimum viable operational practice.
