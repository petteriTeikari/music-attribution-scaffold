research_notes: >
  The music-tech ecosystem includes ~50 companies across 6 tiers
  (generation, attribution, rights management, certification, content ID,
  metadata). Key signals to track: funding rounds, partnership
  announcements, patent filings, regulatory submissions, and API launches.
  For a research project, curated alerts provide sufficient coverage
  without over-investment.
