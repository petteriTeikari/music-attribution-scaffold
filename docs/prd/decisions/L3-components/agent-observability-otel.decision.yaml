# Agent Observability (OpenTelemetry)
#
# OpenTelemetry-based observability for agent interactions and LLM calls.

decision_id: agent_observability_otel
title: "Agent Observability (OpenTelemetry)"
description: >
  Determines the agent observability approach. Options range from no
  dedicated agent observability to Logfire/Langfuse integration to
  full OpenTelemetry-native tracing with GenAI semantic conventions.

options:
  - option_id: none
    title: "None — Basic Logging Only"
    description: >
      Standard Python logging for agent interactions. No structured
      tracing or span creation. Simple but loses the ability to
      correlate agent actions across tool calls and model invocations.
    prior_probability: 0.30

  - option_id: logfire_langfuse
    title: "Logfire / Langfuse Integration"
    description: >
      Integrate Pydantic Logfire or Langfuse for structured agent
      tracing. Automatic span creation for tool calls, model invocations,
      and validation errors. Dashboard for cost tracking and latency
      analysis.
    prior_probability: 0.45
    status: selected

  - option_id: full_otel
    title: "Full OpenTelemetry Native"
    description: >
      Full OTel-native tracing with GenAI semantic conventions. Agent
      traces export to any OTel-compatible backend (Jaeger, Grafana
      Tempo, Datadog). Maximum portability and standards compliance
      but higher integration effort.

research_notes: >
  OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions are on the experimental-to-stable
  track, defining standard span attributes for LLM calls. Pydantic Logfire
  provides OTel-native observability specifically for PydanticAI agents.
  AG2 (AutoGen successor) integrated OTel in Feb 2026, validating the
  approach. Langfuse remains popular but is not OTel-native.

influences:
  - from: observability_stack
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Existing observability stack constrains agent-specific tooling"
  - from: ai_framework_strategy
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "PydanticAI → Logfire natural fit; LangChain → LangSmith"
