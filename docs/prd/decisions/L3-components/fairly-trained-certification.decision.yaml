  Trained certifies entities that train only on licensed or public domain
  data. 19 certified entities as of early 2026.

      applicable) or display Fairly Trained status for certified
      entities within the attribution UI. Market signal for ethical
      positioning.

  - option_id: integration
    title: "Certification Data Integration"

      Integrate Fairly Trained certification status as a signal in the
      scaffold's confidence scoring. Works attributed to Fairly Trained
      certified sources receive higher provenance confidence.

research_notes: >
  Fairly Trained provides a binary certified/not-certified signal that
  complements the scaffold's continuous confidence scoring. Ed Newton-Rex's
  visibility (former Stability AI VP Audio, TED speaker) gives the
  certification high media profile. 19 certified entities include music
  generation companies and training data providers. The certification
  addresses the "was the training data properly licensed?" question that
  the scaffold's metadata-based attribution cannot answer directly.

influences:
  - from: provenance_verification
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Provenance verification strategy determines certification integration"
  - from: regulatory_posture
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Compliance-first posture increases certification value"
