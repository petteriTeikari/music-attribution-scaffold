# Agent Interop Protocol

# Multi-protocol agent communication strategy beyond MCP.

decision_id: agent_interop_protocol
title: "Agent Interop Protocol"
description: >
  Determines the scaffold's agent communication protocol strategy.
  MCP provides tool access; A2A enables agent-to-agent coordination;
  multi-protocol approaches combine both with additional layers.

options:
  - option_id: mcp_only
    title: "MCP Only"
    description: >
      MCP as the sole agent communication protocol. Sufficient for
      tool-based interactions. The scaffold's current approach.
    prior_probability: 0.50
    status: selected

  - option_id: mcp_plus_a2a
    title: "MCP + A2A"
    description: >
      Combine MCP (tool access) with A2A (agent coordination). Enables
      the scaffold's agents to delegate tasks to external agents and
      receive delegated tasks from other systems.
    prior_probability: 0.35
    status: candidate

  - option_id: multi_protocol
    title: "Multi-Protocol"
    description: >
      Full multi-protocol stack: MCP (tools) + A2A (coordination) +
      identity layer (XAA or OAuth 2.1 profiles). Maximum interoperability
      but highest integration complexity.
    prior_probability: 0.15

  MCP governance via AAIF (Linux Foundation) reduces protocol risk.
  A2A v0.3 introduces Agent Cards and task lifecycle management.
  The convergence thesis (MCP + A2A + identity) is emerging but
  not yet stable. XAA (Okta) proposes agent-specific auth flows.

influences:
  - from: api_protocol
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "MCP-primary protocol determines baseline agent communication"
  - from: ai_framework_strategy
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Framework choice affects multi-protocol support"
