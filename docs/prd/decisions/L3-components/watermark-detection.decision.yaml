# Watermark Detection
#
# Whether and how the scaffold integrates digital watermark detection
# for AI-generated content provenance.

decision_id: watermark_detection
title: "Watermark Detection"
description: >
  Determines the scaffold's approach to digital watermark detection for
  establishing AI-generated content provenance. Options range from no
  watermark capability to passive detection of existing watermarks to
  active watermarking of attributed content.

decision_level: L3_components
status: stub
last_updated: 2026-02-14

options:
  - option_id: none
    title: "None — No Watermark Capability"
    description: >
      No watermark detection or embedding. Attribution relies entirely
      on metadata and content identification. Simplest approach but
      misses provenance signals embedded by AI generation platforms.
    prior_probability: 0.50
    status: selected

  - option_id: passive_detection
    title: "Passive Watermark Detection"
    description: >
      Detect existing watermarks embedded by AI platforms (SynthID,
      AudioSeal, C2PA manifests) without embedding new ones. Adds a
      provenance signal to confidence scoring. Requires decoding
      libraries for each watermark format.
    prior_probability: 0.35
    status: candidate

  - option_id: active_watermarking
    title: "Active Watermarking"
    description: >
      Both detect existing watermarks AND embed attribution watermarks
      in scaffold-processed content. Creates a chain of provenance.
      Requires watermark embedding infrastructure and careful audio
      quality management.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  Google's SynthID and Meta's AudioSeal are the leading AI audio
  watermarking systems. C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and
  Authenticity) provides a content credentials standard. EU AI Act
  Article 52 requires AI-generated content labeling, which may drive
  watermark adoption. However, audio watermarking robustness against
  transcoding and compression remains an active research challenge.

    rationale: "Provenance verification strategy determines watermark detection need"
  - from: provenance_strategy
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "L2 provenance strategy shapes watermark integration depth"
