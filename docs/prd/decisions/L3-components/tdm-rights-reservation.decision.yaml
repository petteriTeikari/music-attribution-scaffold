# TDM Rights Reservation Infrastructure
#
# How the scaffold enables music rights holders to express and enforce
# text-and-data-mining opt-out reservations under the EU DSM Directive
# and GPAI Code of Practice.

decision_id: tdm_rights_reservation
title: "TDM Rights Reservation Infrastructure"
description: >
  Determines the infrastructure for expressing and enforcing text-and-data-mining
  (TDM) rights reservations for music content. Under the EU DSM Directive
  (2019/790), copyright holders can opt out of TDM by expressing rights
  reservations in a "machine-readable" way. The GPAI Code of Practice
  (finalized July 2025) requires AI providers to identify and respect these
  reservations, including robots.txt and emerging standards like llms.txt.

  Music has a structural disadvantage: robots.txt is a web-crawling protocol
  that does not naturally extend to audio content accessed via APIs or streaming
  platforms. The GPAI training data template (mandatory since August 2025)
  requires only "brief narratives" and "most relevant online domains" — too
  coarse for track-level attribution. This gap is exactly what the Permission
  Patchbay (MCP consent infrastructure) is designed to bridge.

options:
  - option_id: robots_txt_only
    title: "robots.txt/llms.txt Only"
    description: >
      Rely on standard web protocols for TDM opt-out: robots.txt for web
      crawlers, emerging llms.txt for LLM-specific signals. Simple to
      implement but structurally inadequate for audio content not served
      via web pages. Music on streaming platforms is invisible to robots.txt.
    prior_probability: 0.25
    status: viable

  - option_id: machine_readable_extended
    title: "Extended Machine-Readable Signals"
    description: >
      Implement multiple machine-readable reservation methods: robots.txt
      for web content, structured metadata tags in audio files (ID3v2,
      Vorbis comments), MCP-compatible permission endpoints for API-mediated
      content. Maps to the Permission Patchbay architecture described in
      SSRN No. 6109087. Medium implementation cost, good coverage.
    prior_probability: 0.50
    status: recommended

  - option_id: proactive_reservation_api
    title: "Proactive Reservation API"
    description: >
      Full reservation infrastructure: a public API where rights holders
      register TDM reservations per-work (ISRC/ISWC-level granularity),
      queryable by AI providers before training. Effectively a "consent
      registry" — aligns with the manuscript's MCP Permission Patchbay
      vision. Highest implementation cost but solves the audio-specific gap.
    prior_probability: 0.25
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  EU Commission consultation on TDM reservation protocols (Dec 1, 2025 -
  Jan 9, 2026) sought input on machine-readable protocols. No finalized
  universal standard yet for audio content. Clifford Chance (Oct 2025)
  analysis confirms that the Code of Practice references robots.txt and
  "additional appropriate means" but leaves music-specific protocols
  underdeveloped.

  Bruegel (2025): GPAI training data template creates "the illusion of
  full transparency" — small publishers and independent music rights holders
  may be entirely omitted due to high transaction costs. Enforcement gap:
  AI Office fines up to 3% of global turnover or EUR 15M, but the Oracle
  Problem means violations may be technically undetectable.

  Digital Omnibus GDPR amendments (proposed Nov 2025): new legitimate
  interest basis for AI training (Art. 88c) with unconditional opt-out
  right. If adopted, voice samples, performance metadata, and artist
  biographical data could be processed for AI training under legitimate
  interest, shifting the burden to the data subject to opt out.

influences:
  - from: regulatory_posture
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Regulatory posture determines depth of TDM reservation infrastructure"
  - from: provenance_strategy
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Provenance strategy determines how rights reservations are tracked"
  - from: rights_management_scope
    direction: peer
    rationale: "Rights scope determines granularity of TDM reservations (recording vs full bundle)"
