research_notes: >
  STIM (Swedish Performing Rights Society) launched the world's first
  collective licence for AI-generated music in September 2025. Sureel AI
  is the technology partner. The pilot covers generative music services
  operating in Sweden with per-output royalty based on attribution
  confidence. Other CMOs (GEMA, PRS, ASCAP/BMI) are evaluating similar
  approaches.
