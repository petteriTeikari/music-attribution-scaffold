# Suno/Udio Licensing Integration
#
# Whether and how the scaffold integrates with the two dominant AI music
# generation platforms.

decision_id: suno_udio_licensing
title: "Suno/Udio Licensing Integration"
description: >
  Determines integration depth with Suno and Udio, the two dominant AI
  music generation platforms. Suno ($2.45B valuation, Warner deal) and
  Udio (UMG/WMG settlements) represent the primary sources of AI-generated
  music content that may need attribution.

options:
  - option_id: no_integration
    title: "No Integration"
    description: >
      No integration with Suno or Udio. AI-generated music from these
      platforms is treated like any other audio file — metadata extracted
      from file tags only.
    prior_probability: 0.55
    status: selected

  - option_id: metadata_extraction
    title: "Metadata Extraction"
    description: >
      Extract and normalize attribution metadata that Suno/Udio embed
      in their outputs (generation parameters, model version, training
      data references). One-way data flow; no API integration.
    prior_probability: 0.30
    status: candidate

  - option_id: attribution_api
    title: "Attribution API Integration"
    description: >
      Integrate with Suno/Udio APIs (if available) to query detailed
      attribution information for specific generated outputs. Bidirectional
      — could provide scaffold's multi-source confidence data back to
      platforms.

research_notes: >
  Suno raised $250M at $2.45B valuation and signed a licensing deal with
  Warner Music Group. Also acquired Songkick (live events), signaling
  platform ambitions beyond generation. Udio settled copyright suits with
  UMG and WMG, pivoting to licensed training data. Both platforms are
  beginning to embed attribution metadata in outputs, but no standard
  format exists. The scaffold's value proposition is strongest when
  platform-embedded metadata can be cross-referenced with external sources.
