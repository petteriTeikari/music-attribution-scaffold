research_notes: >
  SoundExchange announced the AI training authorization registry in
  September 2024, with operational deployment progressing through 2025.
  126M+ ISRCs make it the most comprehensive U.S. recording identifier
  database. The registry concept aligns directly with the scaffold's
  check_permissions MCP tool — SoundExchange provides authoritative
  training consent data for U.S. repertoire.
