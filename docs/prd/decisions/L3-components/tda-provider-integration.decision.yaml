# TDA Provider Integration
#
# Whether and how the scaffold integrates with external Training Data
# Attribution providers beyond the existing training_attribution_integration node.

decision_id: tda_provider_integration
title: "TDA Provider Integration"
description: >
  Determines integration depth with Training Data Attribution (TDA) providers.
  TDA quantifies how specific training data influenced generative model output.
  Options range from no dedicated provider integration (metadata-only) to
  API-based partnerships to self-hosted influence computation engines.

options:
  - option_id: none
    title: "None — Metadata-Only"
    description: >
      No dedicated TDA provider integration. Attribution relies on
      metadata matching from MusicBrainz, Discogs, file metadata, and
      human input. Current scaffold state.
    prior_probability: 0.50
    status: selected

  - option_id: api_partner
    title: "API Partner Integration"
    description: >
      Integrate with one or more TDA provider APIs to receive influence
      percentages and training provenance data. Requires commercial
      agreements and API key management.
    prior_probability: 0.35
    status: candidate

  - option_id: self_hosted
    title: "Self-Hosted Engine"
    description: >
      Run influence function computation locally using research tools
      (DataInf, TRAK, TracIn). Maximum control but requires GPU resources
      and ML engineering expertise.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  TDA is the key technical differentiator for AI music attribution vs
  traditional metadata matching. The field is split between training-time
  approaches (require integration during model training) and post-hoc
  approaches (can analyze existing models). Most commercial TDA providers
  are pre-revenue and pre-product-market-fit as of early 2026.

    rationale: "AI framework determines whether TDA computation is feasible"
  - from: build_vs_buy_posture
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Custom builders may self-host; SaaS teams use partner APIs"
