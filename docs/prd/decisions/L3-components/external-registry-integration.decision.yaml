# External Registry Integration
#
# Whether and how the scaffold integrates with external music rights
# registries (SoundExchange, ISRC agencies, CMO databases).

decision_id: external_registry_integration
title: "External Registry Integration"
description: >
  Determines the integration scope with external music rights registries.
  Ranges from no integration (self-contained metadata) to multi-registry
  lookup across SoundExchange, ISRC agencies, and CMO databases.

options:
  - option_id: none
    title: "No External Registry"
    description: >
      Self-contained metadata from MusicBrainz, Discogs, and file metadata.
      No integration with commercial rights registries. Suitable for
      research scaffold and academic demonstration.
    prior_probability: 0.50
    status: selected

  - option_id: soundexchange
    title: "SoundExchange Integration"
    description: >
      Integrate with SoundExchange AI music registry for recording rights
      verification. SoundExchange announced an AI music registry initiative
      for tracking AI-generated content using human-created recordings.
    prior_probability: 0.30
    status: candidate

  - option_id: multi_registry
    title: "Multi-Registry Integration"
    description: >
      Integrate with multiple registries: SoundExchange (recordings),
      HFA/MLC (mechanical), ASCAP/BMI (performance), ISNI (identifiers).
      Full rights chain verification across the music industry ecosystem.

research_notes: >
  SoundExchange announced an AI music registry in 2025 for tracking
  how AI models use human-created recordings. The Mechanical Licensing
  Collective (MLC) handles mechanical rights in the US. ISNI provides
  unique identifiers for creators. Integration requires commercial
  agreements and API access.

influences:
  - from: data_model_complexity
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Multi-registry requires complex entity resolution across identifiers"
  - from: build_vs_buy_posture
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Registry integrations require engineering investment"
