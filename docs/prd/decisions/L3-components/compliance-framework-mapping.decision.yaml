# Compliance Framework Mapping
#
# Whether and how the scaffold maps between internal AI governance (ISO 42001)
# and supply chain liability (EU AI Act) roles. These frameworks have zero
# terminological overlap — different questions, different consequences.

  Determines the approach to mapping between AI governance frameworks.
  ISO 42001 defines internal management system roles (Top Management,
  AI System Owner, Internal Audit) while the EU AI Act defines supply chain
  liability actors (Provider, Deployer, Authorised Representative, Importer,
  Distributor). There is zero native terminological overlap — ISO 42001 asks
  "who governs AI internally?" while the EU AI Act asks "who is legally liable
  in the supply chain?" Organizations need both, separately, with a bridging
  layer. ISO 42001 covers ~40-50% of EU AI Act high-level requirements but
  leaves conformity assessment, CE marking, EU database registration,
  post-market surveillance, and serious incident reporting as explicit gaps.

    title: "ISO 42001 Only"
    description: >
      Implement ISO 42001 AI Management System Standard as the primary
      governance framework. Covers risk assessment, documentation, competence,
      third-party management. Does NOT cover EU AI Act supply chain obligations
      (conformity assessment, CE marking, post-market surveillance, incident
      reporting). Acceptable for non-EU or pre-revenue MVP.

    title: "Dual Framework (ISO 42001 + EU AI Act)"
    description: >
      Maintain a dual-axis compliance map: ISO 42001 for internal governance
      and EU AI Act for supply chain liability. Each AI system gets both an
      internal role assignment (AI Producer/Provider/Customer per ISO 22989)
      and an EU AI Act actor classification (Provider/Deployer/Importer per
      Art. 3). Bridging layer maps ISO 42001 Annex A controls to EU AI Act
      articles. Recommended by ISACA (2025) and GloCert guidance.
    prior_probability: 0.55
    status: recommended

  - option_id: eu_ai_act_only
    title: "EU AI Act Compliance Only"
    description: >
      Focus exclusively on EU AI Act supply chain obligations without formal
      ISO 42001 management system. Covers legal liability but lacks structured
      internal governance. Risk of fragmented internal practices. May suffice
      for deployer-only organizations using third-party AI.

  Key insight from Achim Korten (LinkedIn, Feb 2026): ISO 42001 roles and
  EU AI Act actors have zero overlap. ISO 42001 asks "who governs AI
  internally?" — EU AI Act asks "who is legally liable in the supply chain?"
  Your AI System Owner (ISO) has no equivalent in the EU AI Act. Your Provider
  obligations (EU AI Act) have no equivalent in ISO 42001.

  ISO 42001 gaps for EU AI Act compliance (GloCert 2025):
    - Conformity assessment procedures
    - CE marking
    - EU database registration
    - Post-market surveillance reporting
    - Serious incident reporting to authorities
    - Instructions for use (detailed content specifications)

  The GPAI Code of Practice (finalized July 10, 2025; approved August 1, 2025)
  provides operational bridge guidance between ISO 42001 controls and EU AI Act
  obligations, particularly for transparency and copyright compliance.

  Digital Omnibus (November 19, 2025) delays high-risk system obligations:
    - Annex III high-risk: Aug 2026 → Dec 2027 (16-month delay)
    - Annex I high-risk: Aug 2026 → Aug 2028 (24-month delay)
    - Art. 50 AI-generated content marking: Aug 2026 → Feb 2027

influences:
  - from: regulatory_posture
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Regulatory posture determines which compliance frameworks to adopt"
  - from: ethics_governance
    direction: downstream
    rationale: "Framework mapping informs governance-as-code implementation"
