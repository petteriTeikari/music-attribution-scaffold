# Audio fingerprinting and content identification approach.

description: >
  Determines the audio fingerprinting and content identification approach.
  Options range from Chromaprint-only (the open-source standard via AcoustID)
  to multi-fingerprint systems to commercial content ID partnerships.

options:
  - option_id: chromaprint_only
    title: "Chromaprint Only"
    description: >
      Use Chromaprint (via AcoustID) as the sole fingerprinting system.
      Open source, well-understood, sufficient for recording-level
      identification. Limited for derivative works or AI-generated content
      that reuses fragments.
    prior_probability: 0.45
    status: selected

  - option_id: multi_fingerprint
    title: "Multi-Fingerprint System"
    description: >
      Combine multiple fingerprinting approaches: Chromaprint for
      recording-level, spectral fingerprints for fragment-level, and
      melody extraction for compositional similarity. Requires more
      engineering but covers more attribution scenarios.
    prior_probability: 0.35
    status: candidate

  - option_id: content_id_partner
    title: "Content ID Partner"
    description: >
      Integrate with commercial content ID services (Audible Magic,
      YouTube Content ID API, Pex). Highest accuracy for production
      music catalogs but introduces vendor dependency and licensing costs.
    prior_probability: 0.20
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  Chromaprint is the de facto standard for open-source audio fingerprinting.
  For AI-generated music attribution, traditional fingerprinting may be
  insufficient — the generated output may not match any existing recording
  fingerprint. Spectral and melodic similarity approaches are more relevant
  but less mature.

influences:
  - from: build_vs_buy_posture
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Custom builders implement multi-fingerprint; SaaS teams use Chromaprint or partner"
  - from: data_model_complexity
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Graph-enriched models can represent fragment-level similarity relationships"
