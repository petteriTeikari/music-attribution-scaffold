# Machine-readable licensing and autonomous transaction capability.

title: "Agentic Commerce Protocol"
description: >
  Determines whether and how the scaffold supports machine-readable
  licensing queries and autonomous commerce transactions. Options
  range from manual human-mediated licensing to machine-readable
  rights queries to fully autonomous negotiation.

    description: >
      All licensing decisions are human-mediated. The scaffold provides
      attribution data but does not participate in licensing transactions.

  - option_id: machine_readable_licensing
    title: "Machine-Readable Licensing"
    description: >
      MCP tools expose machine-readable licensing status (opt-in,
      opt-out, conditional) that AI agents can query programmatically.
      Humans still approve transactions but AI agents can check
      permissions autonomously.

  - option_id: autonomous_negotiation
    title: "Autonomous Negotiation"
    description: >
      Full autonomous commerce: AI agents negotiate licensing terms,
      execute payments (via ACP/TAP), and record transactions. Requires
      commerce protocol integration and significant trust infrastructure.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  ACP (OpenAI + Stripe) provides payment orchestration for agent
  transactions. TAP (Visa) adds agent verification. The scaffold's
  check_permissions MCP tool is already a primitive form of
  machine-readable licensing. Full autonomous negotiation is
  technically feasible but ethically and legally premature for
  music rights.
