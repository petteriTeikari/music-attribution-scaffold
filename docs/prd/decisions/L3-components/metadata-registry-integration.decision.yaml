# Metadata Registry Integration
#
# Breadth of external metadata registry integration beyond the current
# MusicBrainz-focused approach.

decision_id: metadata_registry_integration
title: "Metadata Registry Integration"
description: >
  Determines the breadth of external metadata registry integration. The
  current scaffold uses MusicBrainz as the primary external registry.
  Options range from MusicBrainz-only to multi-registry integration
  to full DDEX compliance for industry-standard metadata exchange.

options:
  - option_id: musicbrainz_only
    title: "MusicBrainz Only"
    description: >
      MusicBrainz as the sole external metadata registry. Sufficient
      for research purposes and indie music. Limited coverage of
      commercial catalog metadata and real-time release data.
    prior_probability: 0.45
    status: selected

  - option_id: multi_registry
    title: "Multi-Registry Integration"
    description: >
      Integrate multiple registries: MusicBrainz (community), Discogs
      (marketplace), ISNI (identifiers), and ISRC/ISWC lookups.
      Requires entity resolution across different identifier systems
      and data quality reconciliation.
    prior_probability: 0.35
    status: candidate

  - option_id: ddex_full
    title: "Full DDEX Compliance"
    description: >
      Implement DDEX (Digital Data Exchange) standard compliance for
      industry-standard metadata exchange. Enables integration with
      major label systems, distributors, and DSPs. Significant
      engineering investment and potentially requires DDEX membership.
    prior_probability: 0.20
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  MusicBrainz has the most comprehensive open metadata for indie and
  catalog music. DDEX is the industry standard for commercial metadata
  exchange but has high implementation complexity. The scaffold's entity
  resolution pipeline is designed to handle multi-source metadata
  reconciliation, making multi-registry integration architecturally
  feasible even if not yet implemented.

    rationale: "Multi-registry requires complex entity resolution across identifier systems"
