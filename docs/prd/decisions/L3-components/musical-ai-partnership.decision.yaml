# Musical AI Partnership
#
# Whether and how the scaffold partners with Musical AI for training-time
# attribution data.

decision_id: musical_ai_partnership
title: "Musical AI Partnership"
description: >
  Determines the partnership model with Musical AI, a company specializing
  in training-time Training Data Attribution (TDA). Musical AI's approach
  requires integration during model training (not post-hoc), making their
  offering architecturally unique. Partnership with Beatoven.ai validates
  their commercial model.

options:

    title: "No Partnership"
    description: >
      No partnership with Musical AI. The scaffold relies on metadata-based
      attribution without training-time TDA data.

  - option_id: data_exchange
    title: "Data Exchange Partnership"
    description: >
      Bilateral data exchange: Musical AI provides TDA influence percentages
      for works in their coverage; the scaffold provides multi-source
      metadata enrichment. API-based, limited scope.
    prior_probability: 0.35
    status: candidate

  - option_id: deep_integration
    title: "Deep Integration"
    description: >
      Full integration of Musical AI's TDA engine into the scaffold's
      attribution pipeline. Training-time influence data becomes a
      first-class signal alongside metadata and fingerprint matches.
      Requires significant engineering coordination and commercial terms.

research_notes: >
  Musical AI has raised $7.3M. Their training-time approach requires
  integration during model training, not post-hoc analysis. Partnership
  with Beatoven.ai demonstrates commercial viability. Key differentiation:
  Musical AI can quantify "how much" a specific work influenced a generated
  output, not just "whether" it was similar.

  - from: tda_provider_integration
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "TDA provider integration strategy determines Musical AI engagement level"
  - from: build_vs_buy_posture
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Custom builders may build own TDA; SaaS teams partner"
