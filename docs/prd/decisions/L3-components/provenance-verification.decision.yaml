# Provenance Verification
#
# How the scaffold verifies the provenance of AI-generated or
# human-created audio content.

decision_id: provenance_verification
title: "Provenance Verification"
description: >
  Determines the depth of provenance verification for audio content.
  Ranges from metadata-only checks (existing ISRC/ISWC lookup) to
  watermark detection (SynthID, AudioSeal) and cryptographic provenance
  (C2PA content credentials).

options:
  - option_id: metadata_only
    title: "Metadata-Only Verification"
    description: >
      Verify provenance through metadata lookup (ISRC, ISWC, MusicBrainz
      cross-reference). No audio signal analysis. Fast and lightweight
      but cannot detect AI-generated content or tampered metadata.
    prior_probability: 0.50
    status: selected

  - option_id: watermark_detection
    title: "Watermark Detection"
    description: >
      Detect embedded audio watermarks (Google SynthID, Meta AudioSeal,
      WavMark, Digimarc). Can identify AI-generated content and trace
      to specific models. Requires signal processing capabilities.
    prior_probability: 0.30
    status: candidate

  - option_id: cryptographic
    title: "Cryptographic Provenance (C2PA)"
    description: >
      Full C2PA content credentials with cryptographic signatures.
      Provides tamper-evident provenance chain from creation through
      distribution. Highest assurance level (A3) but requires
      PKI infrastructure and industry adoption.
    prior_probability: 0.20
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) is backed by
  Adobe, Microsoft, and BBC. SynthID is Google's watermarking for generative
  audio. AudioSeal is Meta's proactive watermarking. The EU AI Act requires
  AI-generated content labeling, which may drive cryptographic provenance
  adoption.

influences:
  - from: provenance_strategy
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "L2 provenance strategy directly shapes verification depth"
  - from: regulatory_posture
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "EU AI Act compliance may require watermark detection or C2PA"
