# AI Music Platform Connector
#
# Whether and how the scaffold connects to AI music generation platforms
# (Suno, Udio, Beatoven.ai) to ingest attribution metadata from their outputs.

decision_id: ai_music_platform_connector
title: "AI Music Platform Connector"
description: >
  Determines integration with AI music generation platforms. As platforms
  like Suno and Udio begin embedding attribution metadata in their outputs,
  downstream systems need infrastructure to consume, normalize, and verify
  this metadata against other sources.

decision_level: L3_components

last_updated: 2026-02-14

options:
  - option_id: none
    title: "None — No Platform Connection"
    description: >
      No integration with AI music platforms. Attribution relies on
      traditional metadata sources (MusicBrainz, Discogs, file tags).
      Platform-generated attribution metadata is ignored.
    prior_probability: 0.50
    status: selected

  - option_id: read_only_metadata
    title: "Read-Only Metadata Ingestion"
    description: >
      Ingest attribution metadata from platform outputs (API or file
      metadata). Normalize against NormalizedRecord schema and score
      confidence. No data flows back to platforms.
    prior_probability: 0.35
    status: candidate

  - option_id: bidirectional_api
    title: "Bidirectional API"
    description: >
      Full bidirectional integration: ingest platform metadata AND provide
      attribution verification results back to platforms. Enables platforms
      to improve their own attribution based on the scaffold's multi-source
      confidence scoring.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  Suno ($2.45B valuation, Warner Music deal) and Udio (UMG/WMG settlements)
  are the dominant AI music platforms. Both are shifting toward licensing-based
  models with attribution metadata. Beatoven.ai has partnered with Musical AI
  for training-time attribution. The platform metadata format landscape is
  fragmented — no standard exists for AI-generated music attribution metadata.

influences:
  - from: platform_strategy
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Integration platform strategy requires platform connectors"
  - from: api_protocol
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "MCP protocol enables standardized tool-based platform queries"
