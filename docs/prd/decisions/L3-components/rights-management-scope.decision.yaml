# Rights Management Scope

# Whether the scaffold tracks recording rights only or the full bundle
# (composition/publishing, performance, mechanical, sync).

title: "Rights Management Scope"
description: >
  Determines the scope of rights tracking in the permission patchbay.
  Music rights are split between recording (master) and composition
  (publishing). AI training may touch both differently — Sureel's patent
  specifically separates compositional vs recording attribution.

options:
  - option_id: recording_only
    title: "Recording Rights Only"
    description: >
      Track only master recording rights (ISRC-level). Simpler model
      but misses composition/publishing rights which are separately owned
      and licensed. Suitable for MVP.

  - option_id: full_bundle
    title: "Full Rights Bundle"
    description: >
      Track recording (ISRC), composition (ISWC), performance, mechanical,
      and sync rights separately. Maps to real-world rights structures
      (CMOs, publishers, labels). Required for production deployment.

research_notes: >
  Sureel's patent portfolio specifically covers compositional vs recording
  separation as a technical innovation. STIM (Swedish CMO) partnership
  validates the full-bundle approach. SoundExchange handles recording
  rights; ASCAP/BMI/SESAC handle composition.

influences:
  - from: data_model_complexity
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Full bundle requires graph-enriched data model"
  - from: regulatory_posture
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "EU AI Act may require full rights provenance chain"
