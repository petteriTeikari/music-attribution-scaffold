# CMO Licensing Integration
#
# Whether and how the scaffold integrates with Collective Management
# Organizations for AI music licensing.

decision_id: cmo_licensing_integration
title: "CMO Licensing Integration"
description: >
  Determines integration depth with Collective Management Organizations
  (CMOs) such as STIM, GEMA, PRS, and ASCAP/BMI. CMOs manage licensing
  on behalf of rights holders. Integration could range from no CMO
  involvement to serving as attribution infrastructure for a multi-CMO
  licensing federation.

options:
  - option_id: none
    title: "None — No CMO Integration"
    description: >
      No CMO integration. The scaffold operates independently of
      licensing infrastructure. Attribution data is available but
      not connected to licensing workflows.

  - option_id: single_cmo_pilot
    title: "Single CMO Pilot"
    description: >
      Partner with one CMO (e.g., STIM) for a pilot integration.
      Provide attribution data to support licensing decisions.
      Limited scope, manageable complexity.

  - option_id: multi_cmo_federation
    title: "Multi-CMO Federation"
    description: >
      Build federation infrastructure enabling multiple CMOs to query
      the same attribution engine. Cross-CMO data sharing protocol,
      conflict resolution for overlapping rights claims, and
      compliance reporting.

research_notes: >
  STIM launched the world's first collective AI music licence (Sep 2025)
  with Sureel AI as technology partner. This creates the first real
  integration surface for attribution scaffolds with licensing
  infrastructure. Other CMOs (GEMA, PRS, ASCAP/BMI) are evaluating
  similar approaches but haven't launched pilots.

influences:
  - from: partnership_model
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "CMO federation requires the CMO federated partnership model"
  - from: regulatory_posture
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "Compliance requirements drive CMO integration depth"
