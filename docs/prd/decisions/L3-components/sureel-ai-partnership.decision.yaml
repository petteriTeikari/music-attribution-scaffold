options:
  - option_id: no_partnership
    title: "No Partnership"
    description: >

      identification and attribution methods.
    prior_probability: 0.45
    status: selected

  - option_id: decoupled_api
    title: "Decoupled API Integration"
    description: >
      Integrate Sureel's decoupled mode API for identification results.
      The scaffold queries Sureel for work identification and receives
      confidence-scored matches. Lighter integration, no shared state.
    prior_probability: 0.40
    status: candidate

  - option_id: integrated
    title: "Integrated Mode"
    description: >
      Full integration with Sureel's attribution graph. Shared entity
      resolution, combined confidence scoring, and joint data enrichment.
      Requires deep technical coordination and data sharing agreement.
    prior_probability: 0.15
    status: candidate

research_notes: >
  Sureel AI provides both decoupled (lighter) and integrated (full) modes.
  As STIM's technology partner for the world's first collective AI music
  licence, Sureel has unique institutional access to CMO infrastructure.
  5 patents pending on their identification approach. Claimed 86-90%
  accuracy, but independent validation is limited.

influences:
  - from: tda_provider_integration
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "TDA provider strategy determines Sureel engagement level"
  - from: cmo_licensing_integration
    direction: upstream
    rationale: "CMO integration creates natural Sureel partnership surface via STIM"
