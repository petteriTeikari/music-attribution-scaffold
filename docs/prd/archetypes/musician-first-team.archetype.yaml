# Musician-First Team Archetype
#
# A small team led by musicians/creators with 1-2 developers.
# Values simplicity, low operational burden, and creator experience.

archetype_id: musician_first_team
title: "Musician-First Team"
description: >
  A team where domain expertise (music industry, artist workflows,
  rights management) outweighs engineering capacity. Typically 1-3 people
  total with at most 1-2 part-time or junior developers. The team
  understands the attribution problem deeply but cannot sustain complex
  infrastructure.

  This archetype represents the "Imogen & Andy" scenario from the
  manuscript — domain experts who need a system that works without
  requiring a DevOps engineer on staff.

team_profile:
  size: "1-3"
  composition:
    engineers: "0-2"
    product: "1 (often the founder/musician)"
    design: "0-1"
    devops: "0"
  technical_experience:
    backend: beginner_to_intermediate
    frontend: beginner
    infrastructure: minimal
    ml_ai: minimal
  budget_range:
    monthly_infrastructure: "$0-200"
    annual_saas_tools: "$0-2000"

hard_constraints:
  - "Zero DevOps burden — everything must be managed"
  - "Must work with free or very low-cost tiers"
  - "No command-line-only workflows for non-technical team members"
  - "Must have visual admin interface, not just API"

soft_preferences:
  - "Prefer all-in-one platforms (Supabase, Vercel) over assembling services"
  - "Prefer no-code/low-code tools where possible"
  - "Prefer visual dashboards over log files"
  - "Prefer established ecosystems with good documentation and tutorials"
  - "Prefer monthly billing over annual contracts"

decision_overrides:
  # L1 Business
  build_vs_buy_posture:
    preferred: saas_maximalist
    rationale: "Cannot sustain infrastructure operations"
  target_market_segment:
    preferred: independent_creators
    rationale: "Serving creators like themselves"
  revenue_model:
    preferred: freemium_saas
    rationale: "Simple PLG model for creator audience"
  regulatory_posture:
    preferred: best_effort
    rationale: "Focus on product, not compliance"

  # L2 Architecture
  data_model_complexity:
    preferred: simple_relational
    rationale: "Simplest viable data model"
  api_protocol:
    preferred: rest_openapi
    rationale: "Most accessible, best documentation"
  service_decomposition:
    preferred: monolith
    rationale: "Single deployable, minimum ops"
  ai_framework_strategy:
    preferred: lightweight_sdk
    rationale: "SDK convenience over raw API"

  # L3 Implementation
  primary_database:
    preferred: supabase
    rationale: "All-in-one with auth, real-time, storage"
  graph_strategy:
    preferred: sql_joins_only
    rationale: "No graph infrastructure to manage"
  vector_strategy:
    preferred: no_vector_search
    rationale: "Fuzzy matching sufficient for small catalogs"
  llm_provider:
    preferred: openai_primary
    rationale: "Broadest ecosystem and tutorial support"
  frontend_framework:
    preferred: nextjs
    rationale: "Most tutorials and templates available"
  auth_strategy:
    preferred: supabase_auth
    rationale: "Bundled with Supabase, zero additional setup"

  # L4 Deployment
  compute_platform:
    preferred: render
    rationale: "Simple PaaS with good free tier"
  database_hosting:
    preferred: supabase_hosted
    rationale: "Bundled Supabase experience"
  ci_cd_pipeline:
    preferred: platform_native_autodeploy
    rationale: "Git push to deploy, nothing else"
  iac_tooling:
    preferred: none_manual
    rationale: "Manual via dashboards is fine at this scale"
  container_strategy:
    preferred: buildpacks
    rationale: "Auto-detect, no Docker knowledge needed"

  # L5 Operations
  observability_stack:
    preferred: minimal_logging
    rationale: "Platform dashboards sufficient"
  scaling_strategy:
    preferred: vertical_only
    rationale: "Small user base, vertical scaling more than enough"
  backup_dr_strategy:
    preferred: managed_provider_backups
    rationale: "Rely entirely on Supabase/Neon backups"
  secrets_management:
    preferred: environment_variables
    rationale: "Platform environment variables, nothing more"
