archetype_id: well_funded_startup
title: "Well-Funded Startup"
description: >
  A Series A+ startup with $5M+ funding, 10-30+ team members including
  dedicated DevOps/SRE, and enterprise customers in the pipeline. The team
  can afford to invest in infrastructure that provides long-term competitive
  advantage. Enterprise credibility (SOC2, SLAs, uptime guarantees) is a
  business requirement, not a nice-to-have.

  This archetype represents the "scale-up" path — what the scaffold looks
  like when resources are available and enterprise customers demand
  production-grade infrastructure.

  size: "10-30+"
  composition:
    engineers: "7-20"
    product: "2-3"
    design: "1-3"
    devops: "2-4"

hard_constraints:
  - "Must support SOC2 compliance path"
  - "Must provide 99.9%+ uptime SLA capability"
  - "Must support SSO (SAML/OIDC) for enterprise customers"
  - "Must have audit logging for all data access"
  - "Must support multi-region deployment option"
  - "Production data encrypted at rest with customer-managed keys"

soft_preferences:
  - "Prefer cloud-native services with enterprise support contracts"
  - "Prefer infrastructure-as-code for all environments"
  - "Prefer distributed database capabilities for future global expansion"
  - "Prefer comprehensive observability with SLA dashboards"
  - "Prefer modular monolith now with clear microservices decomposition path"
  - "Value reliability and maintainability over development speed"
