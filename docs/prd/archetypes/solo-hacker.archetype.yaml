# Solo Hacker Archetype
#
# One person building everything. Maximum velocity, zero ops.
# The "weekend project that might become a startup" profile.

archetype_id: solo_hacker
title: "Solo Hacker"
description: >
  A single developer building an attribution/traceability system, either
  as a side project, a proof of concept, or the seed of a future startup.
  Technical skills may be high, but time and operational capacity are the
  binding constraints. Every decision is filtered through "can one person
  maintain this?"

  This archetype optimizes ruthlessly for simplicity and zero-ops. Features
  that require ongoing maintenance (self-hosted databases, Kubernetes,
  custom monitoring) are effectively eliminated regardless of their
  technical merits.

team_profile:
  size: "1"
  composition:
    engineers: "1 (full-stack)"
    product: "0 (engineer makes product decisions)"
    design: "0"
    devops: "0"
  technical_experience:
    backend: intermediate_to_advanced
    frontend: intermediate
    infrastructure: beginner_to_intermediate
    ml_ai: beginner_to_intermediate
  budget_range:
    monthly_infrastructure: "$0-50"
    annual_saas_tools: "$0-500"

hard_constraints:
  - "Zero ongoing operational tasks (no cron jobs to babysit)"
  - "Must work within free tier limits for initial development"
  - "Single deployment target (no multi-service orchestration)"
  - "Local development must work offline or with minimal dependencies"
  - "No enterprise sales process — self-service only"

soft_preferences:
  - "Prefer SQLite for development, managed PostgreSQL for production"
  - "Prefer serverless/edge for zero-scale-to-zero cost"
  - "Prefer type-safe languages/frameworks that catch errors at dev time"
  - "Prefer single-file deployment configurations"
  - "Value iteration speed over architectural purity"

decision_overrides:
  # L1 Business
  build_vs_buy_posture:
    preferred: saas_maximalist
    rationale: "One person cannot operate infrastructure"
  target_market_segment:
    preferred: independent_creators
    rationale: "Smallest viable market segment, direct reach"
  revenue_model:
    preferred: freemium_saas
    rationale: "Scalable without sales team"
  regulatory_posture:
    preferred: best_effort
    rationale: "No capacity for compliance overhead"

  # L2 Architecture
  data_model_complexity:
    preferred: simple_relational
    rationale: "Minimum viable data model"
  api_protocol:
    preferred: rest_openapi
    rationale: "Fastest to build and test"
  service_decomposition:
    preferred: monolith
    rationale: "Single deployable or serverless functions"
  ai_framework_strategy:
    preferred: lightweight_sdk
    rationale: "SDK for velocity, direct API as fallback"

  # L3 Implementation
  primary_database:
    preferred: sqlite_turso
    rationale: "SQLite for dev, Turso for production. Zero ops."
  graph_strategy:
    preferred: application_layer_graph
    rationale: "NetworkX in-memory for analysis, no graph DB"
  vector_strategy:
    preferred: no_vector_search
    rationale: "Fuzzy string matching sufficient for MVP"
  llm_provider:
    preferred: anthropic_primary
    rationale: "Best quality per token for complex tasks"
  frontend_framework:
    preferred: no_frontend
    rationale: "API-first, build frontend when validated"
  auth_strategy:
    preferred: api_key_only
    rationale: "Simplest auth for API-first system"

  # L4 Deployment
  compute_platform:
    preferred: railway
    rationale: "Free tier, simple deployment, good DX"
  database_hosting:
    preferred: turso
    rationale: "Edge SQLite, generous free tier"
  ci_cd_pipeline:
    preferred: platform_native_autodeploy
    rationale: "Git push deploys, nothing to configure"
  iac_tooling:
    preferred: platform_native
    rationale: "fly.toml or render.yaml, nothing more"
  container_strategy:
    preferred: no_containers
    rationale: "Direct deploy for speed"

  # L5 Operations
  observability_stack:
    preferred: minimal_logging
    rationale: "Structured logging to stdout, read platform logs"
  scaling_strategy:
    preferred: vertical_only
    rationale: "Scale the machine, not the architecture"
  backup_dr_strategy:
    preferred: minimal_git_based
    rationale: "Code in git, data small enough for manual export"
  secrets_management:
    preferred: dotenv_gitignored
    rationale: ".env locally, platform env vars in production"
