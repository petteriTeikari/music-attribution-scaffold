# Multi-Modal Attribution Domain Overlay
#
# Extends the music attribution scaffold to support cross-media attribution
# (audio, image, text, video, symbolic music). Stub overlay for future
# implementation based on Sureel and ProRata multi-modal capabilities.

domain:
  name: multimodal-attribution
  version: "0.1.0"
  status: stub
  description: >
    Domain overlay enabling attribution across multiple media types.
    Extends audio-only attribution to image, text, video, and symbolic
    music modalities. Based on commercial landscape analysis of Sureel
    (multi-modal patent portfolio) and ProRata (cross-media attribution).

cross_modal_attribution:

    Attribution across modalities — e.g., determining if a music video's
    visual style was influenced by a specific album artwork, or if an
    AI-generated song's melody was influenced by a MIDI composition.

decision_overrides:
  training_attribution_integration:
    notes: "Multi-modal requires partner_api or self_hosted — metadata_only insufficient"
  provenance_verification:
    notes: "Cross-modal provenance requires C2PA or equivalent across all media types"
